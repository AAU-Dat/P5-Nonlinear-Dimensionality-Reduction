\section{Summary of theoretical considerations}\label{sec:theory-choice-summary}
In this chapter the theory and theoretical choices have been presented with respect to the elements in the pipeline. This section will summarize these choices.


As data, \gls{mnist} will be used. The preprocessing on \gls{mnist} will consist of reshaping the data and normalizing it with min-max and variance scaling. The features that will be extracted from the data will be extracted by the dimensionality methods \gls{pca}, \gls{lda}, \gls{kpca}, and \gls{isomap}. The reduced data will be used to train a \gls{svm} model. The \gls{svm} model will be evaluated with the metric f1 score. The \gls{svm} model will be tuned with the cross-validation method grid search. The implementation will be based on \gls{sklearn}.
