\section{Summary of the Theory of Choice}\label{sec:theory-choice-summary}
In this section the theory and theoretical choices have been presented. Summing up the choices made in the theory section, the following choices have been made: The dimensionality reduction methods are \gls{pca}, \gls{lda}, \gls{isomap}, and \gls{kpca}. The evaluation metrics chosen are accuracy, recall, precision, f1 score and time. The \gls{ml} model is \gls{svm}. The dataset is \gls{mnist}. For hyperparameter selection, and prevention of overfitting the \gls{ml} model, cross-validation with gridsearch will be used. For preprocessing, the group will work with the original data, with minor tweaks. The data will be reshaped and normalized. The implementation will be based on \gls{sklearn}~\cite{scikit-learn}.
