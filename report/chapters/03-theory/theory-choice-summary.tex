\section{Summary of the Theory of Choice}\label{sec:theory-choice-summary}
%Explain in a summary the choices that were taken in the thoery section.

In the theory section section the choices regarding dimensionality reduction methods have been presented. The methods chosen are \gls{pca}, \gls{lda}, \gls{isomap}, and \gls{kpca}. The chosen evaluation metrics chosen are accuracy, recall, precision, and f1 score. The chosen \gls{ml} model is \gls{svm}. The chosen data set is \gls{mnist}. In order to assure that the \gls{ml} model does not overfit cross-validation will be used.



With respect to preprocessing, the group chose to work with the original data, with some minor tweaks. The data will be reshaped
