\section{Classification}\label{sec:classification}
%What is classification
Classification is a \gls{ml} task where the goal is to predict a class label for a given input. The class label is a discrete value, such as a number or a string. The input can be a single value, such as a number or a string, or a vector of values, such as a list of numbers or a list of strings. The input can also be a matrix of values, such as a grayscale image or a color image. The input can also be a list of matrices, such as a list of grayscale images or a list of color images. The input can also be a list of lists of matrices, such as a list of lists of grayscale images or a list of lists of color images.

%hvad er ovo
\gls{ovo} is a method where the model is trained on all possible combinations of two classes. For example, if there are 5 classes, the model is trained on 10 different models, one for each combination of two classes, this makes it computationally expensive as it has to go througth every combination. The model is then evaluated on all the models, and the class with the highest score is chosen as the predicted class~\cite{james-statistical-learning}.

%hvad er ova
\gls{ova} however is a method where the model is trained faster than in \gls{ovo}, as it only uses one class to distinguish if the data is similar or not. For example, if there are 5 classes, the model is trained on 5 different variations of the model, one for each class. This makes \gls{ova} good to distinguish between the current class that is being modeled from the other classes, however in \gls{ova} it is harder to distinguish between the other classes that is not being trained on. The model is then evaluated on all the models, and the class with the highest score is chosen as the predicted class~\cite{james-statistical-learning}.

%Our choice of ovo and ova
\gls{ovo} is more computationally expensive than \gls{ova}, but is more accurate. The choice of \gls{ovo} or \gls{ova} is therefore a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost~\cite{james-statistical-learning}. The \gls{svm} model is chosen because it is a relatively simple model, and thus \gls{ova} is chosen as it is faster than \gls{ovo}.

%The \gls{mnist} dataset presents a multi-class classification problem, as the images can represent any of the 10 digits. The \gls{svm} model however is a binary classification model, and thus has to be adapted to the multi-class classification problem. There are two approaches to this problem: \gls{ovo} and \gls{ova}.
