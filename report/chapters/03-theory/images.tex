\section{Images}\label{sec:images}
As mentioned before, the project will use the \gls{mnist} dataset; the dataset comprises images; therefore, a digital image consists of pixels. In a grayscale image, each pixel has a value between 0 and 255, where 0 is white, and 255 is black. In a color image, each pixel has three values - one for each color: red, green, and blue; the amount of pixels in a color picture is the same as in a grayscale picture. A 28x28x1 grayscale image has 784 pixels, while a 28x28x3 color image also has 784 pixels~\cite{picture}.

In this project, dimensionality reduction is shown by each pixel representing the image's feature (dimension). As the size of images increases, this quickly becomes a large number of features.
