This section covers the decisions made regarding the evaluation metrics of the results.

As mentioned in~\autoref{subsec:metrics}, many different metrics can be used to evaluate a model. The basic metrics used in this project were accuracy, precision, recall, and F1. These metrics were used as they each have their strengths and weaknesses. Some of these strengths and weaknesses of the metrics were described in~\autoref{subsec:metrics}.
Another metric used to measure the performance of the models was the time it took to train them. Depending on the circumstances, the time it takes to train a model could be more important than the accuracy of the model, depending on the loss of accuracy. Such as, if a model takes 10 minutes to train but only loses 1\% accuracy, it might be worth using that model compared to another model that takes a few hours.

Based on the reasons stated, the metrics used in this project were chosen: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and time. These metrics were used in the pipeline to evaluate the results and performance of the models.
