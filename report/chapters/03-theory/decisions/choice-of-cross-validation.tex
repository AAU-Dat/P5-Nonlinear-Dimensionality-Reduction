\subsection{Choice of cross-validation}

This section describes why cross-validation was chosen in this project. Cross-validation is a part of the pipeline and the project in general because it now only allows hyperparameter tuning without the test set but also because it allows for exploration of data while keeping the test set clean \cite{james-statistical-learning}.
