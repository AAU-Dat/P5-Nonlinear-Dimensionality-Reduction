\chapter{Discussion}\label{cha:discussion}
Discuss the results from chapter \ref{cha:results} and compare them to the problem statement in section \ref{sec:problem-statement}. Also, discuss the methodology and the theoretical background in chapter \ref{cha:methodology}. Finally, discuss the project as a whole and the process of the project.

What went well? What could have been done better? What would we do differently next time? Perhaps include thoughts on UN sustainability goals.
