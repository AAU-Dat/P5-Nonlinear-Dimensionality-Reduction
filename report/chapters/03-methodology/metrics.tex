intro
In this project the differens dimmensionality reduction methods are evaluated based on how much it improves the metrics of our models. The following paragraphs will go through these chosen metrics
. After that the reason for the choices will be explained.
what we have chosen
There are 4 metrics which will be used to evaluate the FE through the model. These metrics are acurracy, precision, recall, F1-score. And there is 1 metric used to evaluate FE directly.
Here the speed/computations is used to evaluate the effeciency.

why did we choose these

The four model metrics simply because they are the standard metrics for evaluation of classification. This can be seen through multiple kaggle competitions and scientific papers.
referenced(). The last metric was chosen to show the tradeoff most models will have in the more time it takes the better results. This makes it possible to show which metric will actually be most useful
in most cases since accurracy is often important only to a certain point.
