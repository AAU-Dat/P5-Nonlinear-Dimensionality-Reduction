\subsection{What is Mnist}

"The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. "


\subsection{Why is it intresting}

it's very used so it easy to compare
to

we want somthing simple so we can better see the effects of fixed

We also think we can get more general learning when we dont have to worry about assumptions as much. such as if the classes are evenly distributed.


but it might be too regular to really show Fe so we will augment it so we can explore it in a controlled manner.


\subsection{what is data augmentation}

"Data augmentation in data analysis are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic data from existing data. It acts as a regularizer and helps reduce overfitting when training a machine learning model.[1] It is closely related to oversampling in data analysis." wiki


\subsection{why did we choose dataaugmentaion}

so we can show how the Fe and Model handle different augmentation which could be used to make more general inferences and ituition about Fe and ML it will in particular. show which FE Methods handle things Like rotation s. it will also help show augmentation in general can enhance model performance s.
