\gls{ml} is a field of study within \gls{ai} concerned with learning from data. \gls{ml} is a complex and growing field used in many different areas. One of the reasons for the increasing interest in \gls{ml} is the increasing amount of available data. The amount of data collected in the world is increasing at an incredible rate, which is expected to continue in the future~\cite{data-never-sleeps}. Because \gls{ml} models are trained on data, the more data available, the better the models can be~\cite{Unreasonable-effectiveness-of-data-Norvig}.

However the complexity of \gls{ml} is also high. There are many different \gls{ml} models, each with different strengths and weaknesses. The choice of \gls{ml} model is therefore more often than not dependent on the data and the problem being solved. This means that choosing the right \gls{ml} model is a difficult task, which is further complicated by the fact that there is no single metric for evaluating the performance of a \gls{ml} model. The performance of a \gls{ml} model is often evaluated using multiple metrics, which makes it difficult to compare the performance of different models against each other.

It may be necessary to try out different \gls{ml} models to find the best one for a certain problem, which is a time-consuming process.
