\section{Machine learning models}\label{sec:machine-learning-models}
There are many different models that can be used for classification of the Mnist dataset. One of the most accurate models for this is by using Convolutional Neural Networks, but for now in the repport there will be focus on dimensinality reduction models, such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embeddinng, Logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors and others.

\subsection{Logistic regression}
Logistic regression is a type of statical model, that is used for classification and predictive analytics. It estimates the probability of something given some data, the value of this probability is between 0 and 1. Logistic regression is used in machine learning and is known as a supervised machine learning model. (Supervised machine learning models are defined as models where the data they use is labeled.)

\subsection{K-nearest neighbors}
K-nearest neighbors is another type of supervised machine learning model. The goal of the algorithm is to find the k nearest neighbors of a data point and then classify the data point based on the majority of the neighbors. The algorithm is used for classification and regression. (Classification is the process of predicting a class label for a given data point, regression is the process of predicting a continuous value for a given data point.)

%Notes
CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) is often used for computer vision, and is so far the model that has acchived one of the highest accuracy scores for the Mnist dataset, according to https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-mnist.
