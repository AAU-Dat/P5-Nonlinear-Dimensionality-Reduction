\section{Problem statement}\label{sec:problem-statement}
\emph{This project explores the impact of data preprocessing on the performance of a \gls{svm} machine learning model, for the computer vision problem of image classification and recognition. By data preprocessing is meant dimensionality reduction on augmented data, comparing linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques. The machine learning model is trained on the dimensionality reduced data and the performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. A \gls{cnn} model is also trained on the same data for a discussion on the tradeoff between the evaluation metrics, speed, and explainability. The data used is the \gls{mnist} database.}
