\section{Machine learning}\label{sec:machine-learning}

Figure \ref{fig:basic-machine-learning-pipeline} illustrates a general \gls{ml} pipeline.

A pipeline is good for comparing and contrasting linear and nonlinear methods through the lens of a model efficiently. In this section, there will be a brief Introduction to pipelines, their use, and how to introduce dimensionality reduction to them.

A pipeline consists of four main steps: data, \gls{fe}, \gls{ml} model training, and model evaluation. The first step is the data step, which is the data collection. The \gls{fe} step transforms the data into a more suitable form for the \gls{ml} model. The \gls{ml} model training step trains the \gls{ml} model on the data. The model evaluation step is used to evaluate the performance of the \gls{ml} model. The \gls{ml} model can then be used to make predictions on new data~\cite{machine-learning-pipeline-architecture}.

The \gls{fe} step is where dimensionality reduction will be relevant. This step reduces the dimensions to increase the model's performance.
