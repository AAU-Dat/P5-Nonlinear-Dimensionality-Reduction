\chapter{Results}\label{cha:results}
This chapter presents the results of the project. The results are shown in the form of experiments. All experiments are based on the problem statement from \autoref{cha:problem-statement}. The experiments are presented in the following order:


\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Experiment 1:} How does the choice of dimensionality reduction methods impact the errors, runtime and F1 score of the pipeline, when used with the best hyperparameters?
    \item \textbf{Experiment 2:} How many dimensions can a method reduce before a significant loss of accuracy occurs?
    \item \textbf{Experiment 3:} What impact do kernels and hyperparameters have on the dimensionality reduction methods?
    \item \textbf{Experiment 4:} How does accuracy and training time change when using different amounts of data?
\end{enumerate}



\todo{Rewrite this standard thing}
The second experiment will be done on a subset of the entire dataset. With 15.000 samples in the training set and the usual 10.000 samples in the test set. Instead of the standard 60.000 samples in the training set and 10.000 in the test set. The smaller sample size is used due to memory constraints regarding the nonlinear methods, as they need more memory than was available.
