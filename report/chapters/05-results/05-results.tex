\chapter{Results}\label{cha:results}
This chapter presents the results of the project. The results are shown in the form of experiments. All experiments are based on the hypothesis "Nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods work as well as linear methods on the \gls{mnist} dataset."
The results are presented in tables and figures for each experiment. Tables show the results of each experiment, and figures show the results of each experiment in a visual manner. The experiments are presented in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Experiment 1:} What dimensionality reduction methods work best on the \gls{mnist} dataset, when used best?
    \item \textbf{Experiment 2:} How many dimensions can a method reduce before a significant loss of accuracy occurs?
    \item \textbf{Experiment 3:} What impact does Kernels and hyperparameters have on the dimensionality reduction methods?
    \item \textbf{Experiment 4:} What happens with the dimensionality reduction when the amount of data is reduced, do they still hold for hypothesis?
\end{enumerate}
