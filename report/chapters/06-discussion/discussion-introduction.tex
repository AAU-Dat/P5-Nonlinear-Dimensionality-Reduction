This chapter covers the results from \autoref{cha:results} and compares the findings to the project's problem statement. The discussion aims to answer what went well, what could have been done better and what interesting details were discovered that were not expected and could prove helpful in future projects.

The discussion covers the four experiments done, their purpose, the results gathered from each experiment, and how they relate to the project's problem statement. 
It also covers the effect of the chosen dataset, if \gls{mnist} was the best choice to display the project problem statement, and if not, what alternatives could have been used.
The hyperparameters used will also be discussed, whether or not the correct ones were chosen, their impact on the results, and if they could have been chosen better.
The technical limitations and their impact on the project are also covered, as how memory affected the experiments.
