\section{What we learned}\label{sec:what-we-learned}
To wrap the discussion up, the group will present the insights they have gained from the project. 


In the course of this project, we learned several important lessons about data analysis and machine learning. First, we learned how to construct a comprehensive pipeline for data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, cross-validation, and evaluation. This allowed us to effectively train and evaluate our models on various datasets.

Second, we gained a deeper understanding of dimensionality reduction and its various applications. We explored the differences between linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods,We gained insights into when it is appropriate to use each type of method. We also learned about the curse of dimensionality and the challenges it poses for data analysis.

Third, we gained experience with the svm classification algorithm and its applications. We learned how to use classification algorithms to make predictions on our data and evaluate their performance.

Finally, we learned how to use various tools and techniques to reduce the dimensionality of our data and improve the performance of our models. We explored the use of \gls{pca}, \gls{kpca}, \gls{lda}, and \gls{isomap} for dimensionality reduction, and learned about the strengths and weaknesses of each method.

Overall, this project has given us valuable experience in data analysis and machine learning, and has provided us with a solid foundation for further study and research in these fields.
