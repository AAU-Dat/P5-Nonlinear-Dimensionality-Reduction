\chapter{Discussion}\label{cha:discussion}
This chapter contains a discussion of the results from \autoref{cha:results} and relates the findings to the project's problem statement. The discussion aims to answer what went well, what could have been done better and what interesting details were discovered that were not expected and could prove helpful in future projects.

The discussion starts with the four experiments: their individual purposes, the results gathered from each experiment, and how they relate to the project's problem statement.

Then, the effect of choosing to work with \gls{mnist} is discussed. The chapter covers the effect of the chosen dataset; whether \gls{mnist} was a good choice of dataset in relation to the experiments and the problem statement, as well as what alternatives could have been used.

The chapter continues with a discussion of the insights on effect of memory limitations in the project and as a consideration in future projects.

The chapter ends with a summary of what was learned during the project with regards to dimensionality reduction and \gls{fe}.
