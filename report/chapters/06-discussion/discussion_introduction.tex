\section{Introduction}\label{sec:discussion_introduction}
This chapter covers the results from chapter \autoref{cha:results} and compares the findings to the project's hypothesis. The discussion aims to answer what went well, what could have been done better and what interesting details were discovered that were not expected and could prove helpful in future projects.

The discussion covers topics such as the dataset chosen for the project. It discusses whether \gls{mnist} was an adequate dataset to display the project hypothesis and what other options could have been used. The hyperparameters used, their impact on the results, and whether or not the correct ones were chosen. The technical limitations and their impact on the project are also covered.
