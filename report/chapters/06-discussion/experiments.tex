\section{Hypothesis Testing} \label{sec:experiments}
This section will discuss the experiments we ran to test our hypothesis. The experiments will be discussed in the following order: Experiment 1, Experiment 2, Experiment 3, and Experiment 4. The hypothesis for the project is that nonlinear methods will not be able to outperform linear methods. Running experiments tested this hypothesis to see if the hypothesis held. 

Each experiment has been conducted with a different purpose. Experiment 1 tested the hypothesis by comparing the linear methods' performance to the nonlinear methods' performance. Experiment 2 tested the number of components before a significant drop-off in the accuracy score. Experiment 3 tested the influence kernels have on the accuracy score. Experiment 4 tested the influence of the time it takes; thus, more data samples were used.

The result from experiment 1 shows that LDA is the fastest method, followed by PCA, kPCA, and ISOMAP. This was expected as LDA and PCA are linear methods, and kPCA is a linear method with a nonlinear kernel, making it more computationally expensive. ISOMAP is also a nonlinear method and therefore expected to be slower than both linear methods. By knowing PCA and kPCA is similar, their accuracy scores would be similar. This was expected, as PCA and kPCA are both linear methods, and the only difference is the kernel. ISOMAP should be close in accuracy score, as it is a nonlinear method, but it could have been more accurate than expected, as it is a more complex method. LDA was the least accurate method, as it is a linear method, which was unexpected as it was expected to be one of the most accurate methods. The drop from PCA and kPCA to ISOMAP and LDA was more significant, as the methods were displayed with their best side. By looking at the overall accuracy score, the results in the hypothesis need to be corrected, as the nonlinear methods did outperform the linear methods, as they had a higher accuracy score. The time it takes to run the methods was also tested, and the result shows that LDA is the fastest method, followed by PCA, kPCA, and last, ISOMAP. This was expected as LDA and PCA are linear methods, and kPCA is a linear method with a nonlinear kernel, making it more computationally expensive. ISOMAP is also a nonlinear method and expects to be slower than both linear methods.


The result from experiment 2 shows that the number of components that can remove before the highest accuracy score drops by 1\% is 0 for LDA, 31 for PCA and kPCA, and 20 for ISOMAP. ISOMAP and kPCA expect to be very robust as they are both nonlinear methods, taking more components to drop a percentage. LDA is a linear method and expects a quick drop-off in the accuracy score. PCA expected a quick drop-off in the accuracy score, as it is a linear method. However, as PCA and kPCA are similar, it was expected that both could have a similar number of components removed before a significant drop-off in the accuracy score. The result shows that the nonlinear methods are more robust, as they can remove more components before a significant drop-off in the accuracy score. This also does not hold for the hypothesis, as the nonlinear methods outperformed the experiment's linear methods. Had time been a significant factor for the project other than comparing the different methods, it would have been considered to run the models on a machine with more memory. A machine with more memory could also have allowed running more models on the same machine, which would have been beneficial for comparing the different methods. The machines used for this project did not have the same CPU power. Therefore it could have been beneficial to use a single powerful machine to run all the models. A single powerful machine would have reduced the time to fit the models and allowed more precise comparisons between the different methods.

The result from experiment 3 shows that the accuracy score is the highest for PCA, then the sigmoid kernel, followed by the rbf kernel. The hypothesis says that PCA would outperform the other methods, as it is the linear method in the experiment, therefore the result withhold the hypothesis as the nonlinear methods, the sigmoid and rbf kernels, did not outperform the linear methods in the experiment. 

The result from experiment 4 shows that the methods each grows linearly with the number of samples. This was expected, as PCA and LDA are linear, and therefore expected to grow linearly with the number of samples. ISOMAP and kPCA is the slowest methods, as they are non-linear methods, and therefore expected to be slower than the linear methods. The result holds for the hypothesis, as the non-linear methods did not outperform the linear methods. This is not surprising, as the non-linear methods are more computationally expensive, and the data is not very complex.

\subsection{Discussion on experiments}\label{sec:exp-discussion}
The results from the experiments shows that the hypothesis is correct, as the non-linear methods did not outperform the linear methods. This is not surprising, as the data is not very complex, and sample size is not very big. The nonlinear methods had a overall better score accuracy score than the linear methods, but as the was much slower, which was expected.  


The experiments showed that the hypothesis is correct, as the non-linear methods did not outperform the linear methods. This is not surprising, as the data is not very complex, and the non-linear methods are not very complex either. 



%The results are shown in table \ref{tab:experiments}. The results show that the hypothesis is correct, as the non-linear methods did not outperform the linear methods. This is not surprising, as the data is not very complex, and the non-linear methods are not very complex either. The non-linear methods are also more computationally expensive, which is why we did not use them in the final implementation.
