\chapter{Introduction}\label{cha:introduction}
\todo[inline]{Chapter should probably contain: The initial problem (If we have one), motivation, and the scope or background of the project or theme. Report outline at the end.}
\noindent
In this project we will study some common methods of dimensionality reduction using the MNIST dataset for digit recognition.

\paragraph{Keywords:} dimensionality reduction, linear methods, nonlinear methods, MNIST, Computer Vision (CV), Machine Learning, machine intelligence (artificial intelligence).

Use sources \cite{IBM-machine-intelligence} and \cite{IBM-computer-vision} for superficial overview and explanations of umbrella terms.

Notes to self: Humans vs computers in \gls{nn}. Why are humans good with little training, and computers only accceptable with much more training? Consider perhaps domains (recongnizing epsilon vs. recognizing a 3)

% Might be relevant to us: MNIST and fashion-MNIST (https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

\subsection*{On theory driven projects}
\blockcquote{Projectmodule}{The overall purpose of the project module is for the student to acquire the ability to analyze and evaluate the application of methods and techniques within database systems and / or machine intelligence to solve a specific problem. \textbf{This includes analyzes of the formal properties of the techniques and an assessment of these properties in relation to any requirements for the solution to the specific problem}. [...]

In this project module, the project work is primarily driven by theoretical and analytical considerations about the methods and techniques used. For a specific problem area, a project could, for example, be based on specific performance requirements for the developed software solution, and the project work can thus be guided by the solution's algorithmic time / space complexity as well as formal analyzes and considerations of its theoretical properties and performance guarantees.}
