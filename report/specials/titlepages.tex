In recent years, dimensionality reduction has become an increasingly important topic in the field of machine learning. Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset, while retaining as much relevant information as possible. This can be useful for improving the performance of machine learning algorithms, as well as for visualizing and understanding the structure of a dataset. In this paper, we compare two different types of dimensionality reduction techniques: linear and nonlinear. We apply these techniques to a popular dataset for image classification and recognition tasks, the MNIST dataset, and evaluate the performance of a \gls{svm} model on the reduced datasets. Our results show that, for sample sizes greater than 2000, linear dimensionality reduction techniques are generally faster than nonlinear methods, while achieving similar levels of accuracy. However, nonlinear methods are more robust, in that they can remove more components before a significant drop in accuracy occurs.
