\chapter{Problem Analysis}\label{cha:problem-analysis}
This chapter contains the theoretical background for the project leading to the problem statement.

\todo[inline]{Write about: linear methods, non linear methods, computer vision and machine learning and types of image data. Also, write about the different types of problems that can be solved with machine learning? For example, classification, regression, clustering, etc.? Write about 'not in the set' label. For example recongnition of digits, but have images with alphabet letters, that it can identify as not a number.}
