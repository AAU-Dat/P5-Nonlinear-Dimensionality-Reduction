That is interesting. Not to mention thought\\nprovoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His\\nchildren. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand\\nuntil we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the\\nfinal measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is\\nthe final test.\\nSpecifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven\\nand one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go\\nto one or the other. The \"grading\" on a pass/fail basis is done by God\\nthe Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only\\nGod sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, \"...who can know it.\" I\\nwould say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.\\nThat is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain\\nand ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and\\ntomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part\\nof the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly\\nwouldn\\'t be going to Heaven.

DH allows both ends to agree on\\na session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\\nlike DES) for the encryption.\\n\\nHow could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\\npossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\\nthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\\nkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\\nused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\\n\\nAnother possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\\nsimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip\\'s own\\ninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\\nusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip\\'s\\nsecret key doesn\\'t need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\\nidentical to the secret back-door key.

It is \\ndisingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\\nor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \\nsolely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\\nIt seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem\\non the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,\\nand heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.\\nI will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of\\nwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \\npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \\nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \\nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you\\'re gonna hurt our soldiers\\nyou\\'re gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \\nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\\nIsrael\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \\nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \\nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \\nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\\n\\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\nwould have resulted in.  \\nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \\nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel\\'s \\npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \\nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \\npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \\naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\\n  \\n\\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\\n\\nYes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.\\nThe real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave\\nIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an \\noccupying soldier is attacked.\\n \\n', '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tI think the Manta is the European name for the \"GT.\"  I\\'m pretty sure\\nthat the only Kadett\\'s sold here were/are the Pontiac LeMans.

If I\\ndon't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.\\n\\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\\nlow cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \\nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\\nbillion for the US share.\\n\\nI didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that\\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\\nthat's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or\\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round\\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights...

Anyone\\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and\\nequipment would weigh?\\n\\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \\nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\\nengines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \\nI've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\\nDC-1.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.

The question is,\\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\\nus who have bikes are familiar.\\n\\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \\na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \\nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \\npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \\nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \\nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \\nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \\nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\\nwas the rotation that did it.\\n\\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\\ncountersteering.\\n\\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \\nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \\n\\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\\nbehaviour is consistent with it.

I use a program called Disk Technician \\nGold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by \\nhaving a device driver detect whenever more than one read is \\nnecessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, \\nand minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.

It gave me this \\nmessage twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program \\nand did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining \\nfor new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about \\nsectors for a brief period of time.\\n \\n        I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the \\nexact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the \\nsame error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went \\nto the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough \\nthere was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, \\nbut removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, \\neither audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the \\ncache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.\\n \\n        Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix \\nthem, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are \\nno errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other \\nfiles, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them \\nfor a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to \\ncompletely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through \\nthe c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.\\n \\n        Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on \\nmy hard drive?

Just about the only Democrat champions of the \\nprogram were people like me who were out there at the grassroots \\nlevel, governors and senators.

The OAM is a small division of \\nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \\nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \\nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \\navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \\nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \\nto become involved in AIDS.  \"They have to look successful and there is no \\neasy answer in AIDS,\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the \\nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \\nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \\nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \\ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists\\' \\ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \\nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \"The OAM advisory \\npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \\nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research.\"   \\nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \\nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \"Here is a \\nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It\\'s only fair to give the \\nOffice time to gel, but  it\\'s up to the public to insist that it\\'s much, much \\nmore [than  public relations].\" \\n======================================================================   \\n\"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers\" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, \\nNo. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) \\n\\n     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-\\n6 can attack the human immune system\\'s natural killer cells.

Scientists previously knew that the natural \\nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso\\'s  \\nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \\nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \\nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \\nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \\nbody.  Lusso\\'s  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \\nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \\nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV\\'s attack.   Researchers concluded that \\nherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. \\n\\n    ======================================================================   \\n                                April 15, 1993 \\n     ====================================================================   \\n\\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\" Journal of the \\nAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, \\nGeorge and Nordenberg, Dale F.) \\n\\n     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only \\nensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health \\nproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert \\nand Dale F.

Dr. Berkley\\'s editorial on why American doctors  should care \\nabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for \\nthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should \\nbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it \\nis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  \\nrespiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic \\ndevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  \\nBerkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have \\non many developing countries, and the increased need for international \\nassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political \\naggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there \\nis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach \\nto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in \\nparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \"Earth in the \\nBalance\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable \\ninternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child \\nsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the \\ndeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  \\nchange the future of worldwide health. \\n====================================================================   \\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\" Journal of the American \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nMedical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) \\n\\n     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible \\nbefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less \\nattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller \\nFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and \\nNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as \\nmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  \\neconomic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention \\nthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is \\nreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most \\ndeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic \\ndiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another \\nyear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS \\nand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden \\nbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a \\nrampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each \\nindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley \\nsays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  \\neconomic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he \\nconcludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the \\nUnited States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries \\nwith high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  \\nhas been the rule.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n                               AIDS/HIV Articles\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children\\n                                H H S   N E W S\\n     ********************************************************************\\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\\n                                March 29, 1993\\n\\n\\n        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children\\n\\n\\nThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental \\nHIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency \\nvirus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. \\n\\nThe trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 \\nchildren recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide.

It will be several years, however, before researchers \\nknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. \\n\\nThe results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined \\nclosely for other reasons as well.  \"This trial will provide the first insight \\ninto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\" said \\nDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID\\'s division of AIDS.  \"We need this \\ninformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent \\nHIV infection in children.\" \\n\\nIn the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city \\nareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. \\n\\nNearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during \\npregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than \\na one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing \\nnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection \\ndrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding \\nincrease in the numbers of infected children. \\n\\nHIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  \\nThe most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV \\ndevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These \\ninfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of \\nchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms \\nleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. \\n\\nAt least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger \\nto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older \\nparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no \\nsymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen \\nliver or spleen.

Although the \\nHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals\\' \\nimmunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \\nitself caused the skin disease. \\n\\nOur findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \\nwithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \\nNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \\ndescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \\nRetroviruses. \\n\\nDeveloping animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \\nanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \\nproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \\nHIV as well as their own genetic material. \\n\\nNIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \\neggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \\ncontained both normal and transgenic animals. \\n\\nInstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \\ngenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \\nafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \\nincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \\n\\nSome of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \\nnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \\nlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \\nskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \\n\\nStudies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \\ntype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \\ncause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \\nanimals. \\n\\nTissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \\npresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nEvidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \"turned \\non,\" or active, said Dr. Kopp. \\n\\nThe scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \\nmice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common \\ninfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals\\' immune \\nsystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \\nskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \\n\\nFurther proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \\nexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV \\ngenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  \\nPapilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the \\ngenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No \\nlesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. \\n\\nThe transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter \\nDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \\nDiseases. \\n\\nCollaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. \\nNickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; \\nDr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, \\nformerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS\\n                                H H S   N E W S\\n                 ********************************************\\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\\n\\n                                 March 4, 1993\\n\\n\\n     HHS Secretary Donna E.

The service is \\nfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of \\nSan Francisco General Hospital. \\n     Secretary Shalala said, \"One goal of this project is to share expertise \\nso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health \\ncare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces \\ntreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and \\ncommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients \\nwith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\" \\n     Secretary Shalala said, \"This clinical expertise should be especially \\nhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in \\ncommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\" \\n     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and \\nit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) \\nMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer \\nquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and \\nhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be \\nanswered as quickly as possible. \\n     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question \\nrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment \\ninformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, \\nliterature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health \\ncare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate \\nsources of information or materials. \\n     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken \\nby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse \\npractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and \\ninpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant \\nasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current \\nmedications, sex, age and the patient\\'s HIV history. \\n     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nresponded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern \\nCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA\\'s Bureau of Health \\nProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and \\nby the American Academy of Family Physicians. \\n     \"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of \\ncare they are able to provide to their patients,\" said HRSA Administrator \\nRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  \"This project will be a great resource for \\nhealth care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.\" \\n     \"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care \\nprofessionals and experts on HIV care management,\" said HRSA\\'s associate \\nadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources \\nDevelopment, G.

The system for the\\n   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to\\n   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.\\nBut DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now,\\nso the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break!\\n*At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they\\nneed to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search\\nfor the other 40-bit key.\\n\\nSimilarly, it didn\\'t say \"We\\'re making encryption is commercially available.\"\\nbecause encryption *is* already commercially available, including\\nforms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA.\\nAnd phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were\\nconvinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.\\n\\nThe next thing it didn\\'t say is \"We\\'re making encryption legal\",\\nbecause of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the\\nPresident can\\'t change the First Amendment merely by decree.\\nWhat it *did* say was:\\n\\tIn making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the\\n\\tprivate sector from developing, or the government from approving,\\n\\tother microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in\\n\\tassuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.\\nwhich clearly means \"We\\'re making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.\\nSoon.

This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \\n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\\nitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles\\n\"regular\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care\\nof rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \"proper\" way\\nto do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is\\nguaranteed to be mapped.\\n\\nThe problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window\\nis already visible and mapped.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n That\\'s what the book says.  We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.

So there are\\nthree inputs required.\\n\\nA decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable\\ninput, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all\\noutputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output\\nwill be low).\\n\\nAn eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to\\nselect which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your\\naim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note\\nthat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since\\nyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left\\nonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.\\n\\nA sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus\\na mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use\\nthe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the\\nfour enable lines.\\n\\nOf course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the\\nfour final stage decoders.\\n\\nPlease give me the credit when you submit your homework.\\n\\nJohnH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\\\/           School of MPCE\\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\\n\\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\\n', 'op that worked was the \"Macintosh\\r|> >Software\" loop (whatever that means).\\r|> \\r|> I doubt this is a Quadra-specific problem.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire\\ncelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)\\nswing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.\\n\\n2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\\n\\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\\n\\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\\nindex is near the optimal level.\\n\\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\\n\\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10.

Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\\nnot metering the data correctly.

The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will\\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it\\'s OK. This\\nis why married women usually didn\\'t work until recent decades.\\n2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \\nand slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without \\nquestion by ordinary people, who can\\'t make decisions for themselves.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:\\nThey were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were\\nobligated to do whatever their \"Father\" said to.  Being forced to leave the \\nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\\n\\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is ideal.  Get-\\nting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.\\n3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.\\n4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and \\nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \\nthemselves.\\n5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from\\nlearning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.\\n\\n1990\\'s philosophy:\\n1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless\\nnamed \"Hillary Clinton\" or \"Murphy Brown\".\\n2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people \\n(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on current philosophy:\\nThey were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge\\nrather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge\\nand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-\\nselves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were \\nREWARDED by being allowed into the \"real world.\"\\n\\nLessons from new interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is at best\\na temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn\\nis ideal.\\n3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.\\n4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and\\nshould consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and \"alter\\nor abolish\" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.\\n5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge\\nbut should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children \\nwithout good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better\\nlife for their children (and themselves).\\n\\nI have tentatively named this new philosophy \"The Church of Eveism\" because\\nEve\\'s decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind\\'s first good decision, instead\\nof its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly\\na protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek \\nknowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the\\ndecision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention\\nand desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it \\nuntil it was actively sought.\\n\\n---End serious discussion.

Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a\\ncontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of\\n\\n + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.\\n + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?\\n + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!\\n + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\\n\\nI am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and\\ncan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as\\n\\n + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!\\n\\nThere are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whatever\\nGod happens to want.\" But if that is so, then the statement that God\\nis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.\\nThat being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He\\nis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is\\npowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he\\ntells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you\\ndefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes\\nsense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you\\ndon\\'t. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to\\nGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.\\n\\nAny theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any\\nfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)\\nmeaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements\\nare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements\\nin particular cases about the course of action most likely to\\nachieve a good result.\\n\\nWhen I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in\\nhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what I\\nmight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.\\nMoreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural\\nworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might\\n\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of\\nthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort\\nof difficulties that they find in Nature.\")\\n\\nNow, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an\\nargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.\\nOn the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose\\nthat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every\\ntime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \"Good move!\\nJust what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if\\nI were playing.\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a\\nchess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at\\nleast some of his moves will have me thinking, \"Now, what do suppose\\ninduced him to do that?\" or even, \"Boy, that was a real slip -- he\\'s\\njust thrown the game away!\" Similarly, if God understands the\\nworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that\\nsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.\\n\\nOne difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the\\ncontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess\\ngame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was\\ncarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.\\nHowever, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a\\ntime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did\\nnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had\\nthought.\\n\\nWith God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total\\nresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging\\nthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier\\nthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.\\n\\n     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****\\n\\nIn the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph\\'s ten older brothers,\\nwho (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell\\nhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and\\nwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his\\nfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \"Do\\nnot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\"\\n\\n\\n        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events\\n   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued\\n   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,\\n   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\\n   and of Judaism.\\n        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\\n   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\\n   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\\n   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\\n   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\\n   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\\n   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\\n   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\\n   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\\n   the Promised Land.\\n        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\\n   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\\n   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\\n   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\\n   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\\n   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\\n   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\\n   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\\n   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\\n   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\\n   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\\n   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\\n   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\\n        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\\n   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\\n   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\\n   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\\n   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\\n   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\\n   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\\n   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\\n   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\\n   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\\n   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\\n   of all humans everywhere.\\n        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\\n   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\\n   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\\n   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\\n   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\\n   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\\n   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\\n   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\\n   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\\n   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\\n   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\\n   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\\n   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\\n   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\\n   saved them.\\n\\n        [Other examples here omitted for brevity\\'s sake.]\\n\\n        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\\n   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\\n   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\\n   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\\n   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\\n   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\\n   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\\n   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\\n   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\\n   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\\n   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\\n   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\\n   at Walt Disney, she said, \"And now, my special thanks to the\\n   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\" It was the most\\n   memorable line of the evening.\\n        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\\n   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\\n   to this day, beginning with Joseph\\'s brothers, and continuing\\n   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\\n   Epiphanes....\\n\\nAfter the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\\nprivately and said, \"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren\\'t\\nyou?\" He answered, \"If that is an example that came to your mind,\\nthen you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\\ntalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" I assume\\nthat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\\nstate of Israel.\\n\\nSomeone hearing the rabbi\\'s lecture might leap to the conclusion\\nthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\\npurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\\non to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God\\'s doing -- that He\\nstirred up Joseph\\'s brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\\nthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh\\'s\\nheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\\nAnd this raises questions about how an action can be considered\\nwicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\\nbrought about.\\n\\nI suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\\na log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\\ninstead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\\nthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\\nthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\\nknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\\nof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\\nobservers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\\npiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\\npresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\\ngreat work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\\nlooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\\ncontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\\nbut a different one. So, if Joseph\\'s brothers had not sold him, God\\nwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\\nbut He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\\nbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\\nJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\\nPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\\nJesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\\nCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\\nSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas\\' sin to redeem us. If\\nJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\\nthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\\nhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\\ninterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\\njust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\\ngame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\\nand had attacked Fisher\\'s knight instead (don\\'t bother to look up\\nthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\\nnone the less valid).\\n\\nThus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\\nPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\\nwas not God\\'s doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God\\'s\\nplans by behaving justly and courageously.\\n\\nWhat, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"I\\nwill harden Pharaoh\\'s heart, so that he will not let the people go\"?\\nSome Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\\nwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\\nwere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\\nthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: \"If you see\\nthat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\\ndiscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\\npurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\\nlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\\nresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\\nhistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\\nthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\"\\n\\nTo return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\\nthat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\\ninstruments of God\\'s will?\\n     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\\nJoseph\\'s brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\\npunishment.\\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.', '\\n\\n | You certainly do not see OTC preparations advertised as such.\\n | The only such ridiculous concoctions are nostrums for premenstrual\\n | syndrome, ostensibly to treat headache and \"bloating\" simultaneously.\\n | They\\'re worthless.\\n\\n\\n | That\\'s not the idea, and no, they don\\'t work.\\n\\n\\tI *believe* there is a known synergism between certain\\nanalgesics and caffiene.

Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\\nit was a major story.\\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\\nstyles of host.\\n\\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \\nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \\nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning \\'guys\\')\\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \\neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\\nyou can\\'t get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\\n\\n2PM to 4PM:\\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \\nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\\nare often hilarious.  \\n\\n4 PM to 7 PM:\\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\\nMike Missanelli but I just can\\'t stomach Steve Fredericks.  \\nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\\nhomer now.  I don\\'t listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \\nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\\n\\n7 PM to Midnight:\\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\\nJets, or St. John\\'s basketball.  If the game is on the\\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\\nDuring the summer, it\\nis all talk on WIP.\\n\\n\\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \\n\\n\\n\\n            Rich', 'I recently had to move and forgot to update my address to the Orthodox\\nmailing list.

We had a discussion\\nabout it a while ago. \\n\\n\\nThen OFM comments :\\n\\n\\nWith my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration\\nis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\\n\\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\\n\\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\\n\\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn\\'t  quite go the\\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\\nEvangelical Churches.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\\nMonophysitism.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\nNabil\\n\\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\\n    \\'-------------------------------------------------------------\\'\\n\\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\\nheretical probably aren\\'t.\\n\\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\\nrejected who didn\\'t intend heresy, but simply used language that was\\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\\nthe Antiochene tradition.', \"AllThe Devil ReincarnateSWR meter for CB radios\\n\\nTD>From: ssave@ole.cdac.com (The Devil Reincarnate)\\nTD>Organization: CDAC, WA\\nTD>What\\nTD>is a good choice for a CB? 1/4 or 1/8 wave?\\nTD>  I read the installation instructions on a 1/4 wave antenna,\\nTD>and they suggested that I use an SWR to tune it at channel 12\\nTD>and channel 32 for a minimum reading.

The neighbors said that \\nthere weren\\'t any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of \\nthe building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later \\nfound out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri\\nAvakian was killed, too.\\n\\nWhen the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go \\nhome. We went back up to our place and again didn\\'t turn on the light. We \\nstarted to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We\\ntried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We\\ndecided she had already left.\\n\\nWe sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my\\nfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father\\'s\\nwork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our\\ntown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get\\nout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn\\'t want to give him our address,\\nbut my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the\\ncall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke\\ndown the door and came into the apartment . . .\\n\\nThey came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians \\nwere. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we \\ncould do. One of them took my parents\\' passports and began to read them. He \\nread the surname \"Danielian,\" turned the page, read \"Armenian,\" and that alone\\nwas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the \\ncourtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, \\npushed some of the keys on the piano and said \"your death has tolled.\" They \\nhad knives and steel truncheons.\\n\\nI had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t use it. I just knew that if\\nI didn\\'t give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents \\nand said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded\\nthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken \\noutdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to\\npush her so she\\'d walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind \\nher. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began \\nbeating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.\\n\\nWe are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their \\nbalconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they \\nstrike me, and I\\'m knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I \\nlose consciousness often . . . I don\\'t see or hear my parents, since I was the\\nfirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are\\nlying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from \\ntheir balconies. That\\'s it. I try to pick them up, but can\\'t. My left arm is \\nbroken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an \\nambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.\\n\\nWe were attacked at around 9 o\\'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and \\ntry to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors\\' door, \\nthey push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our \\nneighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she\\nsends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the \\nwindow to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can\\'t see very far as a \\nresult of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken \\naway. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken \\naway, and everything will be OK.\\n\\nBut they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the\\nambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received\\nattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 \\no\\'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with \\nsome \"assistants.\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, \\nand I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds\\non my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o\\'clock I and the other Armenians who are \\nin the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.\\n\\nIn my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them\\nArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only\\nAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,\\nbefore the 27th.\\n\\nThen I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was \\nreleased, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first \\nthey told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out \\nthat they were dead. My father\\'s older brother told me.\\n\\nMy father\\'s name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My \\nmother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the \\nleader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.\\n\\nThey were also beaten on the head. The coroner\\'s report stated that their\\nheads were smashed open and bled profusely.\\n\\nAt the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out \\nlater, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called \\nspecifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address \\nand dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn\\'t know the address.\\nBefore the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the \\nphone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He \\ndenies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father \\nanswered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he \\ncalled from home, which also isn\\'t true. I heard noise and the sounds of \\nautomobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had \\nnever served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 \\nyears old. I don\\'t know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he \\nwas the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.\\n\\nMy parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was \\ntwo years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to\\ngo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He\\nwent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural \\nprojects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and \\nlater moved to Sumgait, helping with the town\\'s construction. Mamma was from \\nthe village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in \\na bookstore, and later, on a construction site.\\n\\n\\nMy sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I\\nalways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it\\nwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and\\nwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military\\nSchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-\\nsider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join \\nthe Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life\\nlong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it\\nmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,\\nand he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.\\n\\nNow I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home \\nof my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.\\n\\nWhile in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had\\nsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at\\ntheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long\\ntime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I\\nalso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped\\n\\n. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,\\nabout a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with\\nhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and\\nhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even\\ncame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But\\nin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of\\nothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .\\n\\nToday Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,\\nwas shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to \\nrecognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\\nI was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision\\nof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of \\nArmenia.\\n\\nAfter the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give\\nKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live\\npeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they\\ncan do that.\\n\\nI arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.\\nAfter a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I \\nthink that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.\\n\\nYou can\\'t take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno\\nKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had \\neven decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move \\nhere for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and \\nthat what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was\\nwrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct \\na mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies \\nin the hands of our government.\\n\\nJune 13,1988\\n\\nStepanakert \\n', 'Hi folks,\\n]\\nDoes anybody know for a good 32-bit C++/C compiler for OS/2 that supports\\nOS/2 API and Microsoft windows (maybe Windows NT)?\\n\\nthanx', '\\n[A GOOD DEAL OF HEALTHY IF NOT DEEPLY THOUGHT OUT IDEALISM DELETED\\nBELOW.]\\n\\n\\nIf their parent company does business (and they will) on the face of the Earth\\nthen they are vulnerable to govt. sanctions.

Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians\\nintent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The\\nbalancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.\\n\\n\\n\\tThat seems to be the case already, given that heavy\\nweapons aren\\'t commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low\\nnumbers, obviously due to cost, I don\\'t think the superior\\nweapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically\\nsuperior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training\\nincludes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,\\nwhereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.\\n\\n\\n\\tI had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers\\nof a select group, and the like would exercise control over the\\nheavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman\\ntank I certainly wouldn\\'t ask him to give it up.  Follow orders\\nfrom the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,\\nthough, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should\\ntherefore be jointly maintained and operated.\\n\\n\\n\\tThis I\\'ll agree with to a point.  The State having control\\nover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state\\nto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that\\nthe ability of the State to lock them up isn\\'t so easy.  Otherwise,\\nI would have to assume that State control would rest on the\\nauthority of the Governor and militia officers.\\n\\n\\n\\tI\\'m having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,\\nfairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few\\npeople with government support.  Just as you argued above that\\nthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control\\nso one side doesn\\'t have all of them, I can\\'t see where this\\nsituation is alleviated in having the select militia holding\\nall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.\\nI think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that\\nthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the\\nunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.\\n\\n\\n\\tWe have to assume that there would be those who would\\nside with the government-controlled forces, and if they\\'ve all\\nthe equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.\\nI\\'d like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the\\nlocal troups having a few 105\\'s and anti-tank weapons in their\\narmory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the\\ntank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.\\nI suppose I\\'m quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.\\n\\n\\n\\tSo would I, but the resources often aren\\'t available to\\noutfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to\\ncall in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster\\nthan anything else.\\n\\n\\n\\tPerhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think\\nmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up\\nfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton\\ntrucks, HumVee\\'s, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff\\nof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units\\nin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.\\n\\n\\tPerhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy\\nequipment under State control, with little but numbers and light\\nstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the\\nstates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local\\nranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,\\nhence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,\\nthe militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for\\nother responses.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\\n\\n\\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\\n    scintillation proportional counters.\\n\\n\\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\\n\\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\\n    that\\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\\n\\n    While in Jupiter\\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\\n    radiation environment.

I thought I\\'d post it to\\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\\nsaying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What\\'s New\" -\\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\\'s clear that the\\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind\\nchildren\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\\nwhat we can do *now*.   \\n\\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\\n\\n\\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\\n\\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\\n\\nAt 35, America\\'s Space Age won\\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\\nmidlife crisis.\\n\\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\\nrewards.  \\n\\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\\'s science\\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\\npolicy.  \\n\\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\\nto build space station Freedom alone.\\n\\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\\n\\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\\nspace budgets.\\n\\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \\n\\n......\\n\\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\\'s\\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\\nits competitiveness agenda.\\n\\n......', '\\nThey do. According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal\\nmanufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and\\nsubmachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the\\npolice and military being the other two.) Washington D.C. police\\nhave stated that 40% (If I\\'m remembering the figure correctly) of\\nthe guns they conficate were illegally built.\\n\\n\\nIt takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one\\nof reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing\\naround on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he\\'s going to have to \\npay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist\\'s\\ntime for something legal would run about $100. The blackmarket\\nprices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least\\nthose few I\\'ve seen cited in newspaper articles were...)\\n\\n\\nWashington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled\\nrifles within city limits.

It is also illegal for a D.C.\\nresident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and\\nbuy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs\\nand make sure the buyer isn\\'t from another state) so the ban \\ncan not be easily side-stepped.\\n\\n\\nSure. But it you couldn\\'t buy one, you would write your own (in\\nfact, people _did_ write their own 15 years ago...) More likely,\\nyou would find a friend who was a particularly good programer\\nand get him give you a copy of his. Software is a _very_ bad\\nexample for your case: How many people do you know with illegal\\ncopies of $400 word processors?

For\\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\\n\\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\\nfrom past masters.\\n\\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \\nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\\'ve made us mad!  What are these\\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\\n\\n     Well I\\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\\nless than many billions of dollars.\\n\\n     It took some of the last generation\\'s experts to teach us\\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\\'s first rocket was not a\\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\\'s ICBM\\'s didn\\'t take ten years to\\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\\'t cost $1 billion.\\n\\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\\'s to remind\\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\\'s. \\nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\\nlittle, Test a little.\\n\\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\\ndidn\\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\\'d just change\\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn\\'t spend a\\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\\'s the\\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\\'t\\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\\nthreat that he\\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\\nit ran over cost or schedule.\\n\\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\\'t keep in mind its\\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\\nbudget.\\n\\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\\n(See charts)\\n\\n     I\\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\\'s\\nand 1960\\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\\ncan\\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\\n\\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\\n\\n     I say to you -- we\\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\\nbring your view-graphs, and I\\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not\\nincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your\\nprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and\\ndecade long programs.]', '\\n\\nWell, I\\'ve provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you\\n(or others) have provided some counterexamples, mostly ones surrounding\\nmating practices, etc.  I don\\'t think that these few cases are enough to\\ndisprove the general trend of natural morality.  And, again, the mating\\npractices need to be reexamined...\\n\\n\\nNo, but mating practices are a special case.  I\\'ll have to think about it\\nsome more.\\n\\n\\nIndeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems\\nare not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural\\nsystem is a subset of the objective ones.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn\\'t harmful, although\\nit isn\\'t helpful either (to the mating process).  And, when you say that\\nhomosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom, don\\'t you mean \"bisexuality?\"\\n\\n\\nThis is standard jargon.  Read any textbook.  The \"we\" forms are used\\nthroughout.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s right.  The goals themselves aren\\'t inherent.\\n\\n\\nYou could, but such would contradict observations.\\n\\n\\nBut a postulate is something that is generally (or always) found to be\\ntrue.  I don\\'t think your postulate would be valid.\\n\\n\\nYes, and I think the goals of survival and happiness *do* work.  You think\\nthey don\\'t?  Or are they not good goals?', \"First this man promotes the dissolution of the Jews through an\\nintermarriage process, and then says that it will be just a bunch\\nof 'fundamentalist' Jews who will object.

Thanks.\\n\\n\\tCathy\", \"After reading the debate over the Clipper, I have a few things to\\nadd.\\n\\n\\tFirst, most of the people I know who activly use encryption\\nprivately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate,\\nand any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All they\\ncare about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,\\nafter all IS the bottom line. \\n\\n\\tSecond, if I look at all the people I know who use any form\\nof encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who\\nstill insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people \\nlooking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think\\nof anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves\\ntheir methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make\\nmistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are\\njust as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. \\n\\n\\tThird, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly\\nfamiliar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption\\nstratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that\\nsomeone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.\\nThat despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can \\nnot see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.\\n\\n\\tFourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid\\npeople out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the \\nbuilt in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to\\ndo any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going\\nto run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start\\nlooking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. \\n\\n\\n\\tIf nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,\\nthe truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into\\nsimply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything\\nelse. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do\\nnot think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be\\nslowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to \\nconvert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,\\nthe Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.\\n\\n\\n\\tThe bottom line here is that people will use what works, and\\nunavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption\\nrelated charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty\\ncharges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.\\n\\tThe other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide \\nuseage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is\\nout of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box\\nhas been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness\\nto this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along\\nwith the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger\\ndegree.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tSincerly,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tTim Scanlon\\n\\n-- \", '\\nAn interesting interpretation of Revelation 17 and 18 has been given by  \\nevangelist David Wilkerson.  I am not saying that I totally agree with his  \\ninterpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He  \\ninterprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good  \\nold U. S. of A.  That\\'s right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.   \\nThe Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the  \\nWHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese  \\nsuccess of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the  \\nworld.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn\\'t the whole world mourn?  The bible  \\nalso talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am  \\nparaphrasing, of course).  Babylon\\'s sin affected, or should I say, infected,  \\nthe whole world.  It doesn\\'t take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a  \\nstate of moral decay.  Hasn\\'t the American culture and Hollywood spread the \"do  \\nit if it feels good\" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what  \\nMr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls  \\nBabylon \"Babylon the Great\" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on  \\nearth.  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I  \\ndon\\'t think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the  \\nmost powerful nation on earth.\\n\\nAgain, this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own, but I do find it worthy  \\nof consideration.', 'For those of you who might be familiar with Insight Distribution\\n     Network, Inc. and their Multimedia Kits:\\n\\nI\\'m seriously considering buying the Insight Talon TA-2000 MM Kit, which\\nis bundled with the CD-ROM drive with 265-280ms access time, 300Kb dtr,\\nmultispin, multi-session Photo CD capability, etc., and with the PAS-16\\nsound card, etc....

In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my\\nhome) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to\\ndrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn\\'t just the epitome of\\na good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do\\nall the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.\\n\\nMy question:\\nWhat is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I\\nrealize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn\\'t going to\\nbe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a\\nthing).  And I uderstand that I probably can\\'t expect much in the way of\\naccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything\\'s gotta be better than\\ntrying to drive with a hosed ankle.\\n\\nI have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with\\nkettering(sp?) ignition (y\\'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not\\nelectronic.  Maybe you could\\'ve guessed it being an \\'84, but I\\'m just trying\\nto give information as completly as I can).\\n\\nI found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system \\ninstead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy\\nthis CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?\\n\\nIt has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the \\nnegative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I\\nunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read\\nit in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but\\nharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?\\n\\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn\\'t paying real close attention I\\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \\nthe thing off.  I\\'m pretty coordinated, so this doesn\\'t bother me, if it\\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I\\'m ok with it.\\n\\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I\\'m\\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\\nit?\\n\\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\\n\\n\\t1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a\\n\\t    device?\\n\\t2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?\\n\\t3.  Are \"professionally\" installed CCs signifacantly better and\\n\\t    worth the cabbage?\\n\\t4.

But these were\\nmiracles of our parent\\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\\nhave told us - \"you\\'ve lost it!\"  The \"me\" generation is only\\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\\n\\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\\'s work - and yes struggle\\n- to build this nation\\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\\n\\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\\nSchriever\\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\\n\\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \\nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\\'ve listened\\nto your stories.  We\\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \\nAnd we\\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\\ninto today\\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\\n\\n     You told us in the 60\\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\\naviation in the 1920\\'s and 30\\'s - build a little and test a little\\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\\nstarted this program for the SDI.\\n\\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\\'t even\\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\\'t take a decade or more\\nbefore putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you\\ndidn\\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\\'re not going to\\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\\naerospace transportation is real.\\n\\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\\nrelationship.\\n\\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\\n\\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\\nyes - we\\'ll make a little money off it too!\\n\\n     Then - and only then - we\\'ll spend another three years to\\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \\nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\\'s next step to the stars!\\n\\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\\'s first rockets weren\\'t Saturn\\nV\\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.

Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.

But this\\nstrategy wouldn\\'t get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not\\nin the near term.)\\n\\nIn other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence\\ninadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to\\ninterpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I\\'d be surprised\\nthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything\\nbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.\\n\\nNote that that doesn\\'t mean I think it won\\'t be done if technically\\nfeasible.  Just as I\\'m sure many wiretaps are done now without\\nwarrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,\\nstart surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,\\ndecrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation\\ngets a boost from data that, sadly, won\\'t ever be presented to a jury.\\n\\nWhile I\\'m posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this\\narchiving scenario to extremes, read \"Lacey and his Friends\", a\\ncollection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the\\nslippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don\\'t worry folks, it\\'s\\nstored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can\\nget to it.  And by the way, we\\'ll be installing cameras on all major\\nstreets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and\\nteller machines, don\\'t we?\\n\\nAnd then we\\'ll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public\\nplaces.  Then in some private places.  Then we\\'ll make it a crime ever\\nto be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy\\ncubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and\\nafter.  But, see, there\\'s still a right to privacy.  We haven\\'t\\ncurtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it\\'d\\nbe to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a\\nVR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.\\n\\nAnd hey, nobody\\'ll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.\\n\\nAfter all, if you\\'re not doing anything illegal...\\n\\nFunny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became\\npretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn\\'t elminate all\\ncrime in the story.

Apple developed some \\n specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller \\n specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.  \\n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \\n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \\n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the \\n end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \\nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a\\n SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2\\n which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}.\\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\\n SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it \\n needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be \\n very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst \\n {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\\n {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and\\n reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between\\n SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.\\n\\nIBM\\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:\\n[...]\\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \\n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \\n drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.\\n\\nSo at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES \\nthe through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode\\nit blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.\\nThe problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put\\nrates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT\\nthe interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the\\nSCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling\\nprophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which\\nin turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its\\ncost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the\\nRule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt\\nthe cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}', '\\nActually, it is simple.\\n\\nA person P has committed a crime C in country X if P was within the borders\\nof X at the time when C was committed.

The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\\nChrist\\'s answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\\n\\nThere is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John\\nthe Baptist,\\n\\n   \"If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.\"\\n\\nThis also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching\\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\\nthe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did\\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\"If\\nyou care to accept it\").  So I took care to point out, not that the\\nBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes\\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I\\npointedly used \"repeated earth lives\" to distinguish a little from the\\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word \"reincarnation\".\\nThe phrase is Rudolf Steiner\\'s (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too\\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\\nfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing\\'s \"The\\nEducation of the Human Race\".\\n\\nTo return to your original point, Paul\\'s statement about Jacob and\\nEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\\nAnd both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus\\nChrist, in my view.', '\\nThat\\'s the craziest thing I ever heard.

Yesterday was the most recent one;\\nsomeone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.\\n\\nI\\'m really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it\\ncould have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.\\n\\nThere was no note.  I do not know if it was:\\n\\n\\t- someone\\'s idea of an innocent joke, that went awry\\n\\t- someone\\'s sick idea of flirting\\n\\t- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)\\n\\nI dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask\\nme some kind of question, I don\\'t know the answer so I take a military\\nspecification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out\\nfalls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a\\nBible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to\\nCorinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love\\nAssociation?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.\\n\\nI can lock up my desk, but I can\\'t lock up every book I have in the\\noffice.  I can\\'t trust that someone won\\'t shove something into my\\nbriefcase or my coat pocket when I\\'m not looking so that I go home to\\nfind such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone\\nwants to do to my body.\\n\\nTo make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to\\ntreat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for\\nleaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go\\nto the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single\\nperson had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one\\ncould be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my\\nnumber was posted.

Pretty words from the company\\ndo me no good when I\\'m terrified or healing from the latest assault.)\\n\\nAnd please pray that I don\\'t turn into an automaton because of this.\\nThat\\'s my bad habit: \"ignore it and it will go away\", \"you\\'re not worth\\nanyone\\'s time so don\\'t go talking to anyone about this\", \"you\\'re right,\\nyou are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this\\nway\", \"you are just an object\", \"you prostitute your mind to this\\ncompany so why can\\'t others expect you to prostitute your body there as\\nwell?\", \"what makes you think women aren\\'t just possessions, and\\nnothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\"\\nThis is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major\\ndepressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don\\'t come into\\nmy head and stay there, triggering depression.\\n\\nPlease pray that this latest trauma doesn\\'t come between me and God.\\nIn a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to\\nGod, and it\\'s also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can\\nseparate one mentally from God.

Sophisticated\\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\\ninnovative approaches.\\n\\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\\n\\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\\n\\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\\n\\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\\nescrow system.\\n\\nKEY-ESCROW\\n\\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\\ncommunications.\\n\\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\\n\\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\\na final standard within six months of this directive.

Why do you do such a meaningless thing?\\n\\nThe answer is that you think it\\'s fun.  You play the skee-ball over\\nand over because you\\'d like to get better at it, even though you\\'re\\nnot going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you\\nblow ten dollars on it.

(Sorry all HP fans, but I have\\na hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their\\n(excellent) gear).\\n\\nOne of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is\\nwhether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature\\nis to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock\\nthe instrument into real time capture mode.\\n\\n\\nI agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are\\n_beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.\\nHowever, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students)\\nseem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or\\nmore knobs required of a \"real\" scope :-)\\n\\n\\nThis is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated\\nthe latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy\\nalternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has\\na 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time\\ncapture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in\\nthe range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at\\nleast they appear to be logically laid out.\\n\\nOne more thing about the new, \"simpler\", front panels. These instruments\\ntend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement\\nover the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our\\nscopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these\\nswitches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the\\nlongevity of the instruments.\\n\\nJohnH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\\\/           School of MPCE\\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\\n\\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\\n', \"\\nIf anyone is interested in the history of AMORC, I do think Spencer\\nLewis published books about the beginning and his mission.

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \\nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \\nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \\nthe histories I\\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \\nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\\nis possible that the histories I\\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\\nit - would it be in Hitler\\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \\n\\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \\nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \\nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \\nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \\nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \\n1920\\'s.\\n\\n\\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \\nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\\'ve read), I\\'d like to know \\nwhat tainted \"evidence\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \\nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \\naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \\n1920\\'s and 30\\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \\ntime and plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \\nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \\nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \\nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \\nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \\nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \\nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \\nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\\n\\n\\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \\n\\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \\nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \\nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\\'t you write them \\nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\\'t tell from \\ntheir footnotes? I\\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\\'m not going to waste my time\\ntrying to debunk someone\\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\\n\\n\\nGiven that you already consider all evidence \"tainted\", what on earth would\\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\\nconsidered \"shrewd guesses\"?\\n\\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \\nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \\nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail.

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \\netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \\nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\\nof Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\\nthat of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\'s treachings, as well as in\\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.', 'The SDIO has \"contracted\" with the NRL (Naval Research Laboratory) to fly the Clementine Mission.

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\\n\\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\\n\\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\\n\\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\\ncross, would want to share in his death.\", '', '--\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                     mike_johnson@mentorg.com', 'Dear Netters\\nI want to send EMG-signals from a running person to a computer. \\nEach signal is 4KHz wide and there is up to 30 of them on each\\nrunning person.

My concern here is not to convince\\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\\nthere\\'s a wide enough variety of images that it\\'s possible to\\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\\nwhatever the details.

The fact that the fire is\\neternal doesn\\'t mean that people will last in its flames forever.\\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.

I walked past the Eternal\\nFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had\\nwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes\\nbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24\\nVolga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the \\ncar. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,\\nand the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn\\'t have anything on her head, and \\nher hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They\\'re 40 to \\n45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help\\nthem.

They put it on the ground near the \\nEternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle\\naround it. I ask, \"What\\'s going on?\" Someone tells me, \"Come listen.\" Well\\nthey were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \"Brother\\nMuslims, our time has come . . . \" and something else along that line. I\\ndidn\\'t understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to \\nget a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. \\nNew people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And\\nthe comments started: \"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\" and \"There\\'s\\nno need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\" I even heard that: \"All \\nMoscow is behind us.\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this \\nwas no joke. I quietly left and went home.\\n\\nNow before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, \\nthat there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of \\nthings, but I didn\\'t have any idea what was really going on.\\n\\nMy wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt\\'s house in Baku. \\nI didn\\'t say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two\\no\\'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and \\nshouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,\\nlike they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a \\ndemonstration and move slowly.\\n\\nMy wife asks what\\'s going on out there. I say I don\\'t know. I put on some\\noutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd\\npeople are shouting \"Down with the Armenians!\" and \"Death to the Armenians!\" I\\nwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street \\non the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned \\nand went against the traffic--it\\'s one way there--down the Street of the 26 \\nBaku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there \\nwas a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same \\nkind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside \\nfrom the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young\\npeople in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.\\n\\nMy wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of\\nuneasy and said, \"No, let\\'s stay at home instead.\" An hour went by, or maybe \\nan hour and a half. Well, I wasn\\'t keeping track of the time, I can\\'t say\\nexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on\\nthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.\\n\\nI put outside clothes on and went out again. There\\'s noise, an uproar outside,\\nand the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time \\nthere were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more \\naggressive. No, I think, something\\'s wrong here, this isn\\'t any demonstration.\\nThey would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run \\nagain. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I \\nfollowed them. I was thinking I\\'d just watch and see. Who knew where this was \\nleading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one \\nside, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square \\nand heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There \\nwas some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.\\nI heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \"We don\\'t need \\nperestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\" Now what did they \\nmean by \"living like we have been?\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. \\nBut too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense \\nof others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just \\nin Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I\\'ve never seen it \\nanywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.\\n\\nNow at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians\\' \\napartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn\\'t \\nhear them say \"kill them\" over the microphone, I only heard \"beat them and \\ndrive them out.\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then\\nanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off\\nto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and \\nI think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.\\nThere were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn\\'t see any of them try \\nto pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.\\n\\nWell I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no\\ndemonstration, and I had to protect my family.\\n\\nI left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next\\nto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-\\nlor\\'s shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-\\nthing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because\\nafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons\\nin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City \\nParty Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I \\nsaw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the \\ncases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 \\nto 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried \\noff by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing\\nright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe \\nabout the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. \\nWhen I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was \\nabout a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He \\nhas a package in his hand, and he\\'s pulling out anasha and handing it out. I \\nhave never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I\\'ve seen a lot of \\npeople smoke it, I\\'ve seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled \\naround and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.\\n\\nBefore I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. \\nI turned around and saw them running. Well I\\'ll just keep on going like I am, \\nI thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. \\nAnd I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the \\nstreet. He\\'s a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, \\nwhich had \"Ermeni oryum\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \"Death to \\nArmenians!\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don\\'t really\\nknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father\\'s name is\\nRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark\\nblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His \\nfamily, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on \\nNarimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; \\ntheir apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the \\nleft. Now Rafik\\'s little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a \\nnew apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son \\nwas carrying a flag that said \"Death to Armenians!\" I was surprised because \\nbefore this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being \\ndone not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.\\n\\nWell anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \"It\\'s OK, it\\'ll pass, \\nthey\\'re young kids, they\\'ve just gotten all whooped up.\" Naturally I didn\\'t \\nwant her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And \\nthis time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn\\'t \\nsee where. Well I think, here we go, the machine\\'s in motion. They weren\\'t \\nhanding out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn\\'t see people drinking \\nand smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn\\'t unloaded the vodka and \\nhashish to put in a store window!\\n\\nSo the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one \\nwould stop them now, they weren\\'t even trying, although, I\\'ll say it again, \\nthe police were there, I saw them. And it\\'s not just that the police weren\\'t \\nbreaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. \\nTrue, at the time I couldn\\'t even imagine that under our government, our much-\\nvaunted leadership--and I\\'m not afraid to say these words: so many people \\ndied, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I \\ncouldn\\'t imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be \\nspecific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of \\nSumgait, I couldn\\'t imagine that such things could take place.\\n\\nWhen they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \"Let\\'s go upstairs.\" \\nWe went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the \\nevening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.\\nI stopped at \"The Corner,\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I \\nlook and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to \\nthe bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. \\nThe crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed \\ntoward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, \\nwheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as \\nthough it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more \\nnoise, and the glass was flying again.\\n\\nWe spent the night at the neighbors\\'. My apartment was on the first floor,\\nthere was really no way to defend yourself there.\\n\\nIn the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. \\nOn the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or \\nwhat happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the \\nbread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying \\nthere hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing\\nyou couldn\\'t even see him.\\n\\nThat was on the morning of February 28.

Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \"chorion.\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \\nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\\ndiscussing the \"Potter\\'s Field.\"\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler', \"\\n\\nSounds more like an Opel GT.

Mary, as a messenger, \\nhas been given the task to make us be \\'aware\\' of the evil\\nserpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedience\\nto God, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings.   \\nThe children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is \\nbrought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins, \\nto obey God\\'s commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence \\nof The Lamb.\\n\\nAs she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the\\nSon of God in her womb, Mary has been preparing us, the Church,\\nthe Body of Christ, for His second coming (making sure we are \\nprotected from the dragon).  Also, she has been preparing the new \\nEden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.  The new Eden will be\\nthe sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His\\nnext coming.\\n    \\nI relate the story again:\\n    I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions  \\n    in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these      \\n    two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot     \\n    the exact place).  She was  weeping and telling the \\n    children that she is afraid she\\'s \"going to lose her\\n    Son\\'s arm\".  She is mourning too for these          \\n    townfolks because it was their fault that there     \\n    would be drought in their harvest; not much good    \\n    food again this year as it was last year.           \\n                                                        \\n    Mary tells the children:                            \\n*    Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole    *\\n*    week even on Sundays when they should be in church  *\\n*    honoring God.  These townfolks swears and           *\\n*    uses her Son\\'s name in bad words.  That is          *\\n    why her Son\\'s arm is so heavy in pain.              \\n    Then she asked them if they pray.  The children     \\n    said \"hardly\".  She asked them to pray every        \\n    morning and night.  When the children went back     \\n    from work they had to tell somebody about this.     \\n    When the news was spred and after thorough          \\n*    investigation of the incident, the townfolks        *\\n*    were converted and faith and obedience to God       *\\n*    were restored in their community.                   *\\n\\n\\nOnce again, the Lamb succeeds.', \"Could someone please send instructions for installing simms and vram to \\njmk13@po.cwru.edu?

And that ID cards, which Israeli citizens\\nmust carry at all times, identify people as Jews or Arabs, not as\\nIsraelis ?\\n\\n2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders\\nand that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to\\nstate where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be\\n?\\n\\n3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so,\\ncould you provide any evidence ?\\n\\n4.      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of\\nindividuals which were tried in secret and for which their\\nidentities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are\\nstate secrets ?\\n\\n5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied\\nterritories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?\\n\\n6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48\\nto avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their\\nChristian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?\\n\\n7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed\\nan order for ethnical cleansing in 1948, as is done today in\\nBosnia-Herzegovina ?\\n\\n8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as\\nmembers in kibbutzim?\\n\\n9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage\\nmarriages between Jews and non-Jews ?\\n\\n10.

Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday\\'s Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.', \"Pascal Perret, in article <1993Apr21.125750.263@eicn.etna.ch>, wrote\\n\\nFunny thing, the InterNet: I have no idea what xv221 might be - except that it\\nmight be something to do with X-windows on PCs (?

Hope you can join us.\\n\\n\\nOn Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  \\nwill be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  \\nawareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.\\n\\nBill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  \\ncharacterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  \\ntrachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  \\nlead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   \\nThree year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  \\nlast year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  \\nlifetime.  \\n\\nEven though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  \\nof enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  \\nPapillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  \\nsupport for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  \\nnewsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  \\nin the prevention, cure, and treatment.\\n\\nSince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  \\nthose viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  \\nwere available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  \\nattention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  \\nFoundation's mission is to change that. \\n\\nAnyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  \\nMarlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.

This is a pretty broad \\n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \\n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\\n motosports enthusiasts.\\n\\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\\n\\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \\n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \\n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \\n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\\n\\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \\n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \"flame-free\".  \\n\\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\\n ---------------------------------\\n\\n You are welcome to subscribe.

Good thing, because the Blues quit\\nplaying.\\n\\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\\nTampa\\'s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\\nsupervisor John D\\'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\\n\\n``I\\'m glad I didn\\'t see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\\n\\nIf the goal had counted, he\\'d have been more upset than he was by the Blues\\'\\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes.

It slipped away at the end. It shouldn\\'t have, but\\nit did.\"\\n\\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\\'s end.\\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\\nChicago Stadium.\\n\\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\\n\\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\\n\\n``It\\'s a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\\'d have kept working, it would have\\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\\n\\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\\n``We won, and that\\'s all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\\n\\nSome players didn\\'t have a problem.\\n\\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\\'t quit,\" said Rich\\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play.

The score\\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\\n\\n``I told them I didn\\'t want to see the score, I didn\\'t want to know the score,\"\\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\\'s the approach we took.\"\\n\\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\\n\\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\\n\\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\\n\\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\\n\\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \\nrebound of Bret Hedican\\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\\n\\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\\n\\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He\\'s in heaven now, and\\nI know he was watching. I know he\\'s happy.\"\\n\\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\\'s shutout just 18 seconds\\nlater, making it 5-1.\\n\\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\\n\\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\\nperiod.\\n\\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan\\'s second goal stand up as the\\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over.

Below is a very short\\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\\n\\n================================================================\\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\\n\\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.

Certainly the\\npeople who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the\\ninnocent civilians into harm\\'s way.\\n\\nAre you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel\\nshould totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking\\nanother is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects\\ninnocent lives?\\n\\n\\nYour damn right Israel insists on some sort of \"demilitarized\" or \"buffer\"\\nzone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory\\nof Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly\\nsurprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to \\ndo it themselves.\\n\\n\\nWhat? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states \\ncan start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will\\nonly occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the \\nresponsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their \\nsoil. They have to Prove it (or provide some \"guaratees\"), there is no way\\nIsrael is going to accept their \"word\"- not with their past attitude of \\ntolerance towards \"anti-Israel guerillas in-residence\".\\n\\nGood lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop\\nanything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows\\nthem in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in \\'56 and\\n\\'67. Somehow, with that \"limitation\" on the troops \"powers\" I don\\'t\\nthink that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) \"guarantees\" by other parties, the UN is worthless\\nto Israel (but, perhaps useful as a \"ruse\"?).\\n\\n\\nPerhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is\\nthe feeling that it is better that \"many of us die fighting\\nagainst those who attack us than for few to die while we silently \\naccept our fate.\" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of \\nsuffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian,\\nArab and Islamic groups.\\n\\n\\nFrom Israel\\'s perspective, \"concessions\" gets it NOTHING...except the \\nrealization that it has given \"something\" up and now *can only \\nhope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken\\nback* by merely doing so; to \"take back\" tangible items (land,\\ncontrol of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should\\nstay away from.\\n \\nIsrael put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades \\nbefore essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon.\\nThe entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel \\nwould express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state \\ninvolved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure \\nin the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts \\ncommitted by \"private groups\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next \\nround of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and\\ndon\\'t be so idiotic as to suggest \"trust\" for the motivations of\\npresent-day Arab states)?\\n\\nAh, ok...what is \"different\" about the present situation that tells\\nus that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic \\npolicies towards Israel? Now, don\\'t talk about vague \"political factors\"\\nbut about those \"tangible\" (just like that which Israel gave up)\\nfactors that \"guarantee\" the responsibility of those states. Your\\nassessment of \"difference\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions,\\nand most states don\\'t feel confortable basing their existence on that\\nsort of thing.\\n\\n\\nIt has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria,\\nLebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred.\\nOnce Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain \\ncontrol?

I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia\\'s\\nMS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some\\nsites in the U.S.  The three I found were:\\n\\n1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)\\n                                This was the smallest and simplest\\n   of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.\\n   It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra\\n   button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the\\n   title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press\\n   a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would\\n   have been nice if there was an \"ALWAYS ON TOP\" setting for the little\\n   window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified\\n   strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be\\n   a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace\\n   manager makes it an attractive package.\\n\\n2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)\\n                               While this workspace manager offered a\\n   few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming\\n   to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace\\n   is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take \"snapshots\"\\n   of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what \\n   applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,\\n   but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.\\n   With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in\\n   a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this\\n   viewing functionality which is quite useful.\\n\\n3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)\\n                            This is an interesting package, which contains\\n   a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies\\n   include \"Backmenu\", which provides a pop-up root menu when you\\n   press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu\\n   is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,\\n   which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could\\n   say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also\\n   bundled in \"backdesk.zip\" is a program called \"WRUN\", which allows\\n   you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS\\n   instead of using the File Manager to run applications.  \\n   The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite\\n   differently to the other two workspace managers in that it\\n   doesn\\'t provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.\\n   In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,\\n   and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to\\n   focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different\\n   viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which\\n   each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window\\n   allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically\\n   the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area\\n   while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up\\n   of a particular section.', '', '*****************************************************************\\n*                                                               *\\n*                        MONSTER RALLY!!                        *\\n*          ==  For the Right to Own and Carry Weapons ==        *\\n*                                                               *\\n*    TOMORROW, Sunday, April 18, 1993, from 1:00 to 3:30 p.m.,  *\\n*       the Denver LIBERTARIAN PARTY will sponsor a rally       *\\n*              AT THE STATE CAPITOL in support of               *\\n*         the individual right to own and carry weapons.        *\\n*                                                               *\\n* Speakers will include former Colorado deputy attorney general *\\n*  DAVID KOPEL, radio host KEN HAMBLIN, DLP Chair DAVID SEGAL,  *\\n* pistol instructor LENDA JACKSON, and novelist L.

A hundred years ago Armenians again thought \\nthey could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the \\nRussian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian \\nterror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle \\nresorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent\\nTurks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that \\nthey are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia \\ntoday.\\n\\nA merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri \\ntown of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to \\nhave taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military \\noperation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the \\nArmenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been \\nmassacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten \\nand shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed \\nthe Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian \\ninsurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the\\nKarabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City \\nhospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant \\nwere killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to \\ncondemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its \\nsovereignty.\\n\\nSerdar Argic', \"\\n\\nYup.

Ville Siren\\'s slap\\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \\n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn\\'t see the puck since\\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \\n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer\\'s goal\\'s far side.\\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\\n game\\'s final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\\n\\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn\\'t the best.\\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\\n to try no combinations.\\n\\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\\n Stillman good on defense.\\n Some players aren\\'t good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\\n\\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn\\'t have a very good game, we\\'ve seen him\\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland\\'s starting goalie in the WC.\\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team.

What is XFree86?\\n\\n   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with\\n   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and\\n   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:\\n\\n    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,\\n       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require\\n       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of\\n       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by\\n       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield\\n       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.\\n    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default\\n       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now\\n       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately\\n       20% faster than X386 1.2.\\n    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,\\n       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4\\n       with the \\'Advanced Compatibility Package\\', local connections from\\n       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.\\n    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.\\n       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about\\n       the ATI and Trident drivers.\\n    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt\\'s\\n       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).\\n    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is\\n       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the\\n       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.\\n    7) New configuration method which allows the server\\'s drivers and font\\n       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary\\n       distributions.\\n    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.\\n    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA\\n       cards is now included.\\n\\n   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2\\n   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):\\n\\n    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of\\n       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 \\n       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).\\n    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the\\n       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \"two\\n       headed\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only\\n       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).\\n    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.\\n    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to\\n       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for\\n       more information.)\\n    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some \\n       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).\\n    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor\\n       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous\\n       documentation and a lot of experimentation).\\n    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including\\n       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many \\n       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more \\n       information).\\n    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has\\n       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of\\n       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks\\n       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.\\n    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig\\n       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative\\n       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new\\n       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) \\n       manual page for more information on the format of this file).\\n\\n       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file\\n       in the source distribution for full details.\\n\\n   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the\\n   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.\\n\\n4. What OSs are supported?\\n\\n    XFree86 supports:\\n\\tSVR4.2: Consensys V4.2\\n\\tSVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC\\n\\tSVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2\\n\\tLinux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1\\n\\n\\tBSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active\\n\\tBSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.\\n\\n\\tNote that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,\\n\\tbut anyone should feel free to submit patches.\\n\\tIf you are interested in tackling this, send mail to\\n\\txfree86@physics.su.oz.au\\n\\n5. What video hardware is supported?\\n\\n   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:\\n\\n\\tTseng ET4000\\n\\tTseng ET3000\\n\\tParadise PVGA1\\n\\tWestern Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of\\n\\t\\tthe PVGA1, and use its driver)\\n\\tGenoa GVGA\\n\\tTrident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000\\n\\tATI 18800, 28800\\n\\n\\tAll of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\\n\\twith the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in\\n\\t256 color mode.\\n\\n\\tThe monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of\\n\\tvideo memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the\\n\\tET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\\n\\tserver, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.\\n\\n\\tIt appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to\\n\\tnon-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To\\n\\tavoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86\\n\\t1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\\n\\tclock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are\\n\\tdiscovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how\\n\\tthese programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such\\n\\ta program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with\\n\\tfuture XFree86 releases.\\n\\n\\tIf you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,\\n\\tit is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the\\n\\tOrchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not\\n\\twork with them, because Diamond won\\'t provide programming details.\\n\\tIn fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond\\n\\tproducts, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions\\n\\tof code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).\\n\\tIf you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.\\n\\n\\tSome people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA\\n\\tvideo cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the\\n\\tCPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It\\n\\tcould be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset\\n\\ton the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don\\'t have a lot\\n\\tof access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested\\n\\ttheory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not\\n\\tworking on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86\\n\\tworking fine on them.\\n\\n6. What about accelerated boards?\\n\\n\\tAt this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards\\n\\tlike the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available\\n\\tin commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).\\n\\n\\tAn S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact\\n\\t<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.\\n\\n\\tA beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>\\n\\tor <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.\\n\\n7. Why doesn\\'t XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?\\n\\n\\tThe reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the\\n\\t16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\\n\\tcontains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-\\n\\tplanes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\\n\\tof each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-\\n\\tbuffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled\\n\\t16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code\\n\\tcould be modified to support this (or it already may; I\\'m not sure).\\n\\tBut for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer\\n\\timplementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,\\n\\tbut nothing is yet available from the project.\\n\\n8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?\\n\\n\\tObviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run\\n\\tX efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.\\n\\tThe various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending\\n\\ton the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).\\n\\tTo build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will\\n\\tbe required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable \\n\\tlower bound.\\n\\n9. Where can I get source for XFree86?\\n\\n\\tSource patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22\\n\\tfrom MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:\\n\\t\\texport.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)\\n\\t(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)\\n\\n\\tRefer to the README file under the specified directory for information\\n\\ton which files you need to get to build your distribution.\\n\\n10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?\\n\\n\\tBinaries are available via anonymous FTP from:\\n\\t\\tftp.physics.su.oz.au\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tftp.win.tue.nl\\t\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tferkel.ucsb.edu\\t\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/SVR4/XFree86\\n\\t\\tstasi.bradley.edu\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tblancmange.ma.utexas.edu\\t- SVR3 (ISC) binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/ISC\\n\\t\\tftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/pc/isc/XFree86\\n\\t\\ttsx-11.mit.edu\\t\\t\\t- Linux binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/linux/packages/X11\\n\\t\\tagate.berkeley.edu\\t\\t- 386BSD binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86\\n\\t\\tftp.cs.uwm.edu\\t\\t\\t- Mach binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /i386\\n\\n\\tEnsure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may\\n\\tarchive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will\\n\\tcontain a README file that describes what files you need to take\\n\\tfrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections were\\n\\tmade when building the distribution.\\n\\nIV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n11. Installation directories\\n\\n\\tThe top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot\\n\\t(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include\\n\\tfiles, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.\\n\\n\\tThis can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified\\n\\tvia symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is\\n\\tnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed\\n\\talongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.\\n\\n12. Configuration files\\n\\n\\tThe XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\"Xconfig\") on startup.\\n\\tThe search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in\\n\\tthe server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.\\n\\n13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes\\n\\n\\tDavid E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known\\n\\tclock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.\\n\\tThe database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and\\n\\tis in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is\\n\\talso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\\n\\texport.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated\\n\\toccasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the\\n\\tsettings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to\\n\\tDavid for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tIf this doesn\\'t help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file \\n\\twith XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\\n\\tIt may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\\n\\tthis description to get them right.  When you do, send the information\\n\\tto David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tNOTE: The old \\'clock.exe\\' program is not supported any more, and\\n\\t      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot\\n\\t      clock values for a new board, remove the \\'Clocks\\' line from\\n\\t      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The\\n\\t      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\\n\\t      You can use these values to put a \\'Clocks\\' line into your\\n\\t      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\\n\\t      starting the server in the future.\\n\\n14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit\\n\\n\\tIf you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to\\n\\treconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is\\n\\tfully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.\\n\\nV) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n\\tFirst of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).\\n\\n15. SVR4\\n\\tWhy won\\'t my xterm run properly?\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\\n\\tCONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won\\'t run.\\n\\tcsh users should use \\'setenv CONSEM no\\'\\n\\n\\tThe Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping\\n\\tproblems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be\\n\\tinstalled.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.\\n\\n16. SVR3\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that\\'s what you are running.\\n\\n17. 386BSD\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.\\n\\n\\tAlso, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey\\n\\t<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the\\n\\tfile XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:\\n\\n\\t    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\n18. Linux\\n\\n\\tYou must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc\\n\\tjump libraries installed.\\n\\n\\tMake sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel doesn\\'t have TCP support compiled in, you\\'ll have to\\n\\trun the server as \"X -pn\". The default startup configuration assumes\\n\\tthat TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files\\n\\t/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the\\n\\t-pn argument to X386.\\n\\n\\tMake sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\\n\\tnumber 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not\\n\\towned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\\n\\tconsole output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but\\n\\tstartx won\\'t.\\n\\n\\tWhen running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with\\n\\ta tty, for example \"xdm < /dev/console &\".\\n\\n\\tFor more detailed information, please read the file README present\\n\\twith the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.\\n\\n19. Mach\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.\\n\\nVI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?\\n\\n\\tThis section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is\\n\\tfully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.\\n\\tPlease look at those files for information on building XFree86.\\n\\nVII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?\\n\\n20. BSD compatibility library\\n\\n\\tA lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.\\n\\tThe default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a\\n\\twhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\\n\\tseed(). A better way of providing the \\'b\\' functions is to include\\n\\t<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro\\n\\tdefinitions for these in terms of the SYSV \\'mem\\' functions.  If you are\\n\\tlinking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these\\n\\tfunctions, then you should link with libXbsd.a\\n\\n21. ANSICCOPTIONS\\n\\n\\tThis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\\n\\tANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite\\n\\tthe entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you\\'d see\\n\\tsomething like\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tin his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\"-ansi\"\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\\n\\tto get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death\\n\\twith -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because\\n\\tCCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must\\n\\tadd \\'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)\\' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.\\n\\nXFree86 Contact Information\\n\\n    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86\\n    Core Team.

According\\nto Luke 3:23\\n\\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \\n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\\n   the son of Eli,\\n\\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\\nintention of tracing Mary\\'s genealogy (in which case he would have\\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband\\'s, from David\\'s son Nathan.\\n\\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David\\'s\\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\\n\\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \\n\\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\\nnot Jesus\\'s physical father, then the original poster is quite\\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus\\'s messianic heritage are not based on\\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus\\'s divine nature was.\\n\\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph\\'s seed in this\\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\\nhad not \"known\"each other).  Thus the first gospel\\'s dedication of\\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\\n\\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \\nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \\nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \\nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\\ndocuments, and the discussion of \"how this could be\" might bring us beyond\\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\\ndetails are described in Steiner\\'s \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \\nBeing and of Humanity\", \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", and \"The Gospel of St.\\nMatthew\". \\n\\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner\\'s methods and explanation are accepted\\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\\n\\nAs for the passing of one\\'s Jewishness through the mother, this was\\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary\\'s\\nJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal\\nline of descent from David, the king.', '', \"\\n\\nYep.

First \"agricultural\"\\n# slavery was not limited to production of cotton.  In the American south\\n# slave labor was used extensively to grow tobacco, sugar, and rice, all\\n# of which remained labor intensive enterprises well into the 20th century.\\n\\nAnd of course, in states like Kentucky and Virginia, not well-suited to\\nlarge-scale plantations, slave labor was used to make one of the most \\nvaluable agricultural products of all: more slaves.  In some ways, this\\ntreatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying\\naspect of American slavery.\\n\\n# Second, although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to\\n# reduce the demands for labor eventually, it was only in the 1940\\'s \\n# the mechanization of cotton production in the South largely eliminated\\n# the labor intensive character of the operation, long after the \"first\\n# mechanical cotton reaper\" was invented.\\n\\nThis is an interesting question.  Steinbeck\\'s _Grapes of Wrath_\\n(published in the 1930s), uses agricultural mechanization of cotton\\nproduction in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evicted\\nfrom the land.

After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam\\nliner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force.\\nThey told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination\\nof the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or\\noutside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they\\nwould inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet\\nwith a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would\\ncompromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection.\\n(I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim\\nprior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)\\n\\nThe bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity\\ncan be compromised with no visible signs.

Government is not\\ngoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop\\nwhenever they want to.  \\'Court order required\\' has proven to be a rather\\nflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\\nmaterial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\\nperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\\nsystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\\n(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\\nprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\\nresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\\non private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\\ndoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\\nfishing expeditions without the target\\'s knowlege.  Don\\'t give up the\\nright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\\nand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\\nfiguring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).

Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\\nDon\\'t buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\\npast or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\\nand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not \\'unlikely\\'\\nor \\'difficult\\'.\\n\\n\\nSo what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\\nafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\\neasily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\\nwould authorize a tap which wouldn\\'t have been possible otherwise.  This\\nhas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\\nlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\\nhave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\\nfor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\\nin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\\nvia a \\'master key\\'?  I sure don\\'t.\\n\\nThis whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\\nold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\\nwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\\nEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\\nthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\\njust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\\nabout civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\".  The question\\nis \"put people first\" to WHERE?\\n\\nWith the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN\\'T\\nexist a \\'master key\\' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\\nscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\\ncourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\\nBet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\\nthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\\nkeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for \\'next time\\'? After\\nawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\\nthey deem \\'disruptive\\'.  And if they get only one key, that would\\nreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\\nNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn\\'t it?\\n\\nAnd unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\\nI see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\\n:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\\na competitor\\'s Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\\nto be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get\\none the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important\\nconcern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...\\n\\n\\nWhat will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You\\ncan BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.\\nIt is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...

Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but\\nthe principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a\\ngovt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as\\nto \\'safeguards\\'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are\\npretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.\\n\\nDon\\'t work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish\\nbad precidents, please.

I recall ideas presented to this\\ngroup are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...\\n\\nAnother question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not\\nbe used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure\\nbut \"good enough\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full\\ndescription (not a PR non-statement) of just what \"good enough\" means?\\nI think when saying how strong it is, \"good enough\" really means \"not\\nvery\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\\nacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\\nConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\\ncountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\\nrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\\nprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\\nhave this thing to \\'fight crime\\'.  We have allready have our Bill of\\nRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\\nfor yet another \\'noble cause\\', instead we should be trying to repair\\nthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too\\nmany rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\\nsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\\n\"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\\netc).\\n\\nBTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\\nthis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\\nthis thing.

This\\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\\n\\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\\n  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by\\n  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in\\n  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained\\n  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the\\n  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during\\n  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements\\n  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among\\n  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim\\n  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the\\n  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly\\n  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as\\n  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and\\n  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more\\n  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-\\n  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,\\n  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the\\n  Empire.>>\\n\\n[47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de\\n  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;\\n  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,\\n  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU\\n  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek\\n  children in the streets of Salonica.

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\\nand is well referenced. \\n\\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\\n\\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \\nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\\n\\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \\nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\\n\\n\\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet\\'s widow, Aisha, who was recognized\\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\\n\\n\\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\\nI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I\\nrecently reposted something here under the heading \"Islam and Women\" --\\nif it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted\\nfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it\\nstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title\\nwas though).  I will email it to you if you like. \\n\\n\\nYour statement that \"other religions are no different\" is, I think, a\\nstatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than\\nChristianity and perhaps Judaism.\\n\\n\\nAisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also\\nwas, at one stage, a military leader.\\n\\n\\nThe Prophet\\'s first wife, who died just before the \"Hijra\" (the\\nProphet\\'s journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.\\n\\nLucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your\\nviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.', '[ ... ]\\n\\nThen it also supports basing such regulations on ignorance.\\n\\nMiller had disappeared, and nobody bothered to present _his_\\nside to the Supreme Court -- in particular, that sawed-off\\nshotguns were used in the World War I trenches, and in other\\ntight spots ever since guns had been invented.

As for \\'Cyprus\\', In 1974, Turkiye \\nstepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population \\nthere. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, \\nthe intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass \\ngraves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed \\nwhat fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.\\n\\nThe problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of \\noppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot \\nofficials and their violation of the co-founder status of \\nthe Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d\\'etat \\nengineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution \\nto the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked \\nTurkiye\\'s intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and \\nonly as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues \\nconsulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories \\nto the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply \\nwas not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at \\nall. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which \\nwas openly expansionist, stated as \\'Enosis,\\' union with Greece. \\nSince the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish \\npopulation, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder\\nof the republic with the Greek population.\\n\\nThe Greek Cypriots, with the support of \\'Enosis\\'-minded\\nGreeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that\\nstatus and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with\\na minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are\\nnot a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the\\nonly way they could show that was to assert their \\nautonomy in a separate republic.\\n\\nTurkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would\\nrather not be involved with the island. But, given the\\ndismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish\\npopulation in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate\\nof the island\\'s Turks in the hands of the Greeks until\\nthe Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord\\nthe two communities finally reach to guarantee that\\nhistory will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots\\nof their rights, liberties and their very lives.\\n\\n\\n  Source: \\'Cyprus: The Tale Of An Island,\\' A.

I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire\\n(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240\\nall have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly\\nremembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all\\nof them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered\\nDESTAs (DEC\\'s oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used\\nwith a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.\\n\\nMy advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:\\n\\n(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won\\'t add\\n    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going\\n    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which\\n    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.\\n    As for Thicknet, it\\'s a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it\\n    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).\\n\\n(2) On the Mac side, you will need:\\n    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).\\n    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won\\'t run on System 7.1).\\n    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be\\n      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don\\'t use earlier versions on a Centris).\\n    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the\\n      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is\\n      self-terminated or not.\\n    - configure MacTCP to use \"Ethernet\".\\n\\n(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:\\n    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.\\n    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.\\n      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the\\n      DECstation.

What\\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\\n\\n   [Reproduced without permission]\\n\\n\\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\\n\\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\\n\\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\\n\\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\\n\\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\\n\\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\\n\\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\\n\\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\\n\\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\\n\\tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\\n\\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\\n\\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\\n\\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\\n\\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\\n\\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\\n\\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\\n\\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\\n\\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\\n\\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\\n\\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\\n\\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\\n\\n\\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\\n\\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\\n\\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\\n\\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\\n\\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\\n\\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\\n\\tafter the sweetener\\'s entering the market have failed to confirm\\n\\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That\\'s why the\\n\\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\\n\\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association\\'s\\n\\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\\n\\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\\n\\tclean bill of health.\\n\\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\\n\\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\\n\\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\\n\\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\\n\\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\\n\\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\\n\\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\\n\\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\\n\\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\\n\\tof selected foods omitted]\\n\\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\\n\\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\\n\\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\\n\\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\\n\\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\\n\\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\\n\\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\\n\\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\\n\\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\\n\\tContains Phenylalanine.\"\\n', \"\\nNow there's a good idea !

It is the \"L\" word -\\nLOSER !!\\n\\n\\tThat\\'s right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it\\nis all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.\\n\\n\\tRemember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail\\nbuffer can claim they are \"too young\" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.\\nThe eighties were about \"How America Learned to Win Once Again\". Then\\n(wouldn\\'t you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.\\nNo Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer\\n(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no\\nholds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a\\nfew \"little\" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an\\nS&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to\\ncontend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya\\', the God Augustus never had\\nit so good. \\n\\n\\tIn the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one\\ndoesn\\'t deserve one\\'s bounty - or success. So there is a \"kinder and gentler\\ntype of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of\\ndiscourse about people who \"don\\'t get it\". For those of us in the winning\\nbusiness, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no \\nsuggestion of losing.\\n\\n\\tBut what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our \\n\"white male\" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out \\nphotojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one\\nwith a \"Hail Mary\" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind \\'three\\nyards and a cloud of dust\\' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses\\nin the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the \\nweapon of choice these days. \\n\\t\\n\\tWho is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on \\nyour face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This \\nis known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt \\nsure does look natural on Mike doesn\\'t it. Gordon Gekko will never look the \\nsame. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to \\ntake it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?\\n\\n\\tWhat we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is \\nthe same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood\\nused to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott\\ndeclaimed, \"Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will \\nnot tolerate a loser.\" And so on. \\n\\n\\tThe political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and\\nDemocrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some \\n\"equitable\" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a \\nloser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian\\nhomosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined\\nday when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) \\nminority.\\n\\n\\tOr you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most\\nconservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn\\'t care\\nwho\\'s winning and who\\'s losing. In some cases, you might say something\\nabout make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).\\nIn the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a \\n\"neoconservative\" or a \"neoliberal\" depending on how much you want to limit\\nthe pot.\\n\\n\\tEither way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be\\npopular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you\\'ll still\\nbe popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I \\nwould imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it\\nis the only way to go.

One might ask why this happened.  My great-great-\\ngrandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous\\nfarmers.

Furthermore, not all\\nwho consider themselves \"christians\" are (even those who manage to head\\ntheir own \"churches\").  \"Not everyone who says to me, \\'Lord, Lord,\\' will\\nenter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who\\nis in heaven.\" - Matt. 7:21.\\n\\n\\nAgain, what historical documents do you trust?

No one can browbeat you\\ninto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving\\nyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\\nmodern offshoots like the \"new age movement\" teach or does he require God\\'s\\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\\nhelp come?

For the sake of brevity, I\\'ll present them in some separate\\n    points.\\n\\n    1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of\\n    misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the\\n    program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:\\n\\n    - It was alleged that:\" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah\\'s technological\\n    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of\\n    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. \"!\\n    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives \\n    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology\\n    in Iran after revolution.\\n\\n    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors\\n    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen\\n    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in\\n    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and\\n    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.\\n\\n    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi\\n    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most\\n    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total\\n    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million\\n    dead left from the war.\\n\\n    - The translation of Iranian officials\\' talks are not 100% true. For\\n    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: \" It hurts me to\\n    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda.\" The \\n    research.\"!\\n\\n    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought\\n    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to \\n    undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran\\'s\\n    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in\\n    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.\\n\\n    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of \\n    Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the\\n    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed\\n    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account\\n    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its\\n    potential role in improvement of Iran\\'s industries and eventually the\\n    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries\\n    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones\\n    in scientific and industrial efforts.\\n\\n    4- A key point in program\\'s justifications is trying to disvalidate as\\n    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from\\n    Iran\\'s different sites. They say: \"We are not sure if the places visited\\n    by IAEA are the real ones or not\" !, or \" We can not rely on IAEA\\'s\\n    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq\\'s nuclear\\n    activities before\" as if they didn\\'t know that Iraq was trying to build\\n    nuclear weapons!\\n\\n    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the\\n    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,\\n    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking\\n    from the absolute knowledge!\\n\\n       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their\\n    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to\\n    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs\\n    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.\\n\\n\\nMohammad\\n', ' \\n \\nI see, it is not rational, but it is intellectual.

Matthew\\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\\n\\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n\\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\\n    from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\\n\\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\\n\\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun\\'s energy for power from its solar\\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the\\n    geological and biological sense.\\n\\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\\n    that Venus\\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\\n    that of Earth\\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\\n    of an ocean.\\n\\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\\n    the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic\\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\\n    launcher autopilot failed.\\n\\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\\n    images of Mars\\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\\n\\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n\\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\\n\\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\\n\\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\\n    to do so.\\n\\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\\n    the first radar studies of the planet\\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\\n    its batteries failed.\\n\\n\\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\\n\\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\\n\\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\\n\\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\\n\\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\\n\\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\\n\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\\n\\n\\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\\n\\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\\n\\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\\n\\n\\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\\n\\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\\' sky was\\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\\n\\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\\n    engineers\\' efforts through May of 1983.\\n\\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1\\'s lander has been designated the\\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\\n\\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\\n    down on April 12, 1980.\\n\\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\\n\\n\\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\\n\\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\\n\\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\\n\\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\\n    is known). Titan\\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\\' appearance was\\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\\n\\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\\n\\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\\n    discovered. Neptune\\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\\'s liquid at 38K?)\\n\\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\\n    location of the heliopause.\\n\\n\\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\\n\\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\\n\\t     craft in solar orbit.\\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3.

Flyby buses went on\\n\\t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\\n\\t     March of 1986.\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\\n\\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\\n\\t     enroute the following year.\\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\\n\\t     Planet in 1971.\\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\\n\\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\\n\\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\\n\\t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\\n\\t     probe MARINER 9.\\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\\n\\t     with its flyby bus.\\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\\' largest\\n\\t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\\n\\t       human/computer error.\\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\\n\\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\\n\\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\\n\\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\\n    space program remains to be seen.\\n\\n\\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley\\'s Comet within about 7 million km\\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\\'s. The closest\\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\\n\\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\\'s radius)), and the third\\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\\n\\n\\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\\n\\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo\\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March\\n    19, but the spacecraft\\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\\n\\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\\'s atmosphere. Hiten\\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\\n    approach:\\n\\n\\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\\n\\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\\n\\tInclination\\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\\n\\tPeriod\\t\\t: 4.7 days\\n\\n\\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\\n\\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\\n    background.

If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either\\nconfused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the\\nchain inside SGI was misleading them.\\n\\n\\nThere were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came\\nout at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The\\nchassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was\\na pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and\\nage.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the\\nhardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our\\nminds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost\\nfrom the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in\\nthe form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over\\nits lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.\\n\\n\\nPlease, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support\\nor sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks\\nto misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there\\nwill be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,\\nbut that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you\\nare referring to).\\n\\nYes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters,\\nbut that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result\\nin good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into\\nsystems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*\\nyou to buy at end of quarter, after all...)\\n\\n\\nThey don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly\\nthey get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions\\nmay well influence the end product, but that also is life in the\\nindustry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we\\nwon't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we\\ndon't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).\\n\\n\\nBut surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year\\nperiod to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year\\nperiod?

The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems\\nlike heart attack and stroke.\\n\\n'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans\\nusing firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some\\nmay have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in \\nusing firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population.\\n(Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now, \\nbut many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage\\nif anything is low.)\\n\\nAt any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred \\nto as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group \\ncan be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might \\nsupport a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.\\n\\nCertainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.

It\\'s one\\nof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.\\nWhat Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I\\'m sure, is that when people\\nread this they think violent arguments where one member of the family\\ngrabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation\\nwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or\\na tragic accident, especially involving a child.\\n\\n       Unfortunately, that\\'s not the way things stack up.  The majority\\nof that 43 \"times\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone \\nintentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill \\nthemselves.  And why it\\'s popular to try and blame suicides on guns,\\nthe evidence doesn\\'t support this.  Internal studies, as well as\\ncomparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural\\nfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.\\n(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There\\npeople jump off buildings.)\\n\\n       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime\\nis commited by \"non-strangers,\" which mistakenly has been generalized\\nregarding the King County study to mean, \"Friends and family.\"  That\\nis, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on\\nthe mental image that a \"Friend, family member, or child,\" equates\\nto a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of\\nanger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,\\nchildren assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by \\nsomeone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun\\nwas used against a \"friend\" or family member doesn\\'t mean they\\nweren\\'t trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among\\npoor urban families, and those are also the areas most \"at risk\"\\nfor family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may\\nnot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban\\nkid might.\\n\\n       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the\\nonly value of a self-defense firearm.

The\\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not\\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance\\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was\\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived\\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't\\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their\\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had\\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\\n\\n     Q  What federal laws --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't\\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the\\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they\\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but\\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of\\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of\\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were\\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that\\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have\\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.\\n\\n     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground\\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be\\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if\\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane\\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace\\nwhere they could be protected.\\n\\n     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned\\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas\\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks\\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they\\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a\\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\\n\\n     MS.

And when you\\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your\\nmind during those horrendous moments?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had\\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the\\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that\\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues\\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would\\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in\\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were\\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know.\\n\\n     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the\\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate\\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were\\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.\\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.\\n\\n     Thank you.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a\\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't\\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't\\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I\\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I\\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to\\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had\\nelapsed.

The new cryptography scheme was\\nannounced today by the White House and the National Institute\\nfor Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the\\ntechnical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman\\nacknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-\\nsecret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the\\nencryption technology around which the new initiative is built.\\n\\n        According to NIST, the technical specifications and the\\nPresidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To\\nopen the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today\\nfiled a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests\\nwith key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security\\nCouncil and the FBI for information relating to the encryption\\nplan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the\\nComputer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to\\nopen the development of non-military computer security standards\\nto public scrutiny and to limit NSA\\'s role in the creation of\\nsuch standards.\\n\\n        CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in\\ndeveloping the so-called \"digital signature standard\" (DSS), a\\ncommunications authentication technology that NIST proposed for\\ngovernment-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA\\nlawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first\\ntime that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.\\nNSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying\\nthe classification of records concerning its creation of the\\nDSS.\\n\\n        David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the\\nadministration\\'s apparent commitment to the privacy of\\nelectronic communications, as reflected in today\\'s official\\nstatement,  \"a step in the right direction.\"  But he questioned\\nthe propriety of NSA\\'s role in the process and the apparent\\nsecrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from\\npublic scrutiny.  \"At a time when we are moving towards the\\ndevelopment of a new information infrastructure, it is vital\\nthat standards designed to protect personal privacy be\\nestablished openly and with full public participation.

Such connotations\\nare quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the\\neightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar\\nMax Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european\\', but then the\\nNazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan\\' is\\nsynonymous with `nordic\\' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who\\noriginally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans\\nand possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word\\nby Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is\\nnontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim\\nto call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor-\\nshipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.\\n\\n  If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory\\'s book, ``In\\nsearch of the Indo-Europeans\" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica.\\nThe reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature\\nas well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and\\nfor Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible\\nthings done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have\\nno clear claim.', \"\\n\\nAs I've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of\\nthe window manager decoration.

Vital\\nbeliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned -\\nthe Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church\\norganization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the\\nlived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one\\nhopes in the Spirit.

[Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing\\nthe nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into\\nthe christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading\\nGraham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard\\nManley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene\\'s _Monsignor\\nQuixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian,\\nbut such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly,\\nI often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after\\nreading many parts of the Bible.

The function of this spoof chip is twofold:\\n    \\n\\t1) Transmit Channel\\n\\n\\t    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with\\n\\t    a secondary keying variable.

It is probable theere is\\na known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits\\nas used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block\\ncan be determined with only the family key F.

A better approach would be to mutilate the\\nentire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme\\nsuch as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block\\ncan be recovered are lessened.\\n\\nWhat do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the\\nserial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission\\nbecomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol\\ntransmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?\\n\\nOne way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block\\ncontaining M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.\\n\\nThe goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to \\ndetection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law\\nenforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state\\nfor use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.\\n\\nIt is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within\\nthe clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for,\\nrequiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting\\nand decrypting E(M; K);\\n\\nThe spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including\\non the resulting serial data stream.

After all, they are high security encryption systems right?\\n\\nSuper encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without\\nredress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial\\nnumber.

These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators,\\nsuch as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require\\nescalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.\\n\\nThe M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of\\nclipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated\\nby changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream\\nand the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key\\ngenerator synchronized between endpoints.\\n\\nThe useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited\\nbased on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission\\ninterception.

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\\n    150MPH.)\\n\\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\\n    per-tire loads:\\n\\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\\n\\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\\n\\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\\n    all.\\n\\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\\n\\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\\n\\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\\n\\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\\n    normal tires on the car?\\n\\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\\n\\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\\n    of my car?\\n\\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\\n\\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\\n    car should I put them on?\\n\\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\\n\\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\\n\\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\\n    in this Q&A posting?\\n\\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\\n\\nSafety Equipment:\\n\\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\\n\\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\\n\\nBrake Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\\n    always wants to do this.\\n\\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\\n    or badly grooved.\\n\\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\\n    this really a good idea?\\n\\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\\n\\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\\n\\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\\n\\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\\n\\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\\n\\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\\n\\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\\n\\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\\n    economics are questionable for street use.\\n\\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\\n    information at this time.\\n\\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\\n    more.  Is it worth it?\\n\\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\\n\\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\\n\\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\\n    eventuality.\\n\\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\\n\\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\\n    ABS system in your car.\\n\\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\\n    becomes very important.\\n\\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\\n\\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\\n    needed here -- rpw]\\n\\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\\n    not very near the threshold.\\n\\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\\n    take over.\\n\\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \\n\\nGas Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\\n\\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\\n    needs.\\n\\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\\n\\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\\n\\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\\n\\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\\n\\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\\n    cars.\\n\\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\\n    in your gas tank.\\n\\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\\n\\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\\n\\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\\n\\nLubrication Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\\n\\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\\t\\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\\n\\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\\n\\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\\n\\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\\n\\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\\n    your wallet at all times.\\n\\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\\n\\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\\n\\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\\n\\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\\n\\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\\n    as conventional oils.\\n\\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\\n\\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\\n    How often should I change my oil?\\n\\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\\n    of storage.\\n\\nMisc. Questions:\\n\\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\\n    break.  What's the story?\\n\\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\\n\\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\\n\\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\\n\\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\\n    oriented vehicles.\\n\\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\\n\\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\\n    is probably the cause.\", \"\\nI don't know about trains, but I've saw a sign on the back of a\\nGreyhound bus that warns you that your radar detector may be set off.\\nIt doesn't explain why, but it does set off my radar detector.\", \"   >>I'm surprised that you don't consider the acquisition of land by\\n   >>the Jews from arabs, for the purpose of establishing an exclusive\\n   >>state, as a hostile action leading to war.\\n\\n\\nCould you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of \\nIsrael right after it was formed. \\n\\n\\n\\nNo one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity.\\nPalestinians are no exception.

Clearly, Finland\\'s top five players (Winnipeg\\'s\\nSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver\\'s Lumme, Los Angeles\\' Jari Kurri and New York\\'s\\nTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But\\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There\\'s\\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn\\'t be superstars at\\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\\n---\\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa\\'s 22 top\\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \\nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\\nisn\\'t completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\\nwon\\'t have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \\nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \\ncouple of years the same way Edmonton\\'s \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late \\'80s. \\nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \\nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I\\'d settle for a \\ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \\nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, \\nthe amateur draft should be open to anyone. \\n', '\\nExcept for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants\\nare vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling\\ntowers designed and built in the 1890\\'s (a hundred years ago) for\\ncoal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.\\n\\nBasicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when\\nits air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network\\nof pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling\\nand the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the\\nhot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than\\njust air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is\\nrapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently\\nseen rising out of these towers.\\n\\nThat slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because\\nit produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of\\nthe air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.\\n\\nThe towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam\\nsystem of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the\\nboiler and used again.

The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" \\nBefore the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at \\nthe City Party Committee, but they were silent, there\\'s no conversation \\nwhatsoever, and we couldn\\'t figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it \\nwas about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if \\nsomeone gave a speech or not, we didn\\'t know. We bought our tickets. There \\nwere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \\nlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\\nfilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \\nmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \\nArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \\nthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \\nto Armenian girls. I thought that\\'s what they meant because they had demanded \\na girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \\nover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \\nrecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \\nIt got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it\\'s\\nonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \\nEveryone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \\npeople of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \\nauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \\ngradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we\\'ve \\nscared them enough, let\\'s leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \\nme that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \\n\"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \\nthey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \\nhad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \\nfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \\ncould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \\nand it was dark . . .\\n\\nMarina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that\\'s the center of town. Lenin\\nStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \\nsomething about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren\\'t especially \\nlistening, because the way we were feeling we didn\\'t know if we were going to \\nmake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \\nwasn\\'t running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \\npolicemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\\ndoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \\nthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\\nstricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \\nnaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \\nsince he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \\nserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \\nlive literally one stop away. We didn\\'t want to go on foot, not because it was\\ndark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \\ndriver didn\\'t want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \\nhe said he\\'d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \\nOK . . .\\n\\nSo we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \\nhappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \\nwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they\\'re not going \\nto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what\\'s going on, and there\\'s\\nimmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \\ncome, they were going to come, kill us, that\\'s it . . . Somehow we managed to \\ncheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\\njust what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \\ndown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \\nnothing had happened.\\n\\nThat was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn\\'t go anywhere and \\ndidn\\'t call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\\nThat day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn\\'t\\nguess.\\n\\nOn the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\\nhad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \\nMarina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \\nno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \\nmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\\nhome and didn\\'t know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \\nZimogliad, came by at around three o\\'clock I think. We worked together, we did\\nour apprenticeships together, she\\'s a Russian girl. She said that something\\nawful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don\\'t they want Armenians? Well what \\nare they after, if they\\'re already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \\nthat, it\\'s just a demonstration, but it\\'s awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\\nlike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \\ncabs, the buses, well it\\'s just a nightmare.\\n\\nThen Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \\nproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\\nasked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\\non in the courtyard; aren\\'t you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn\\'t know what she\\nwas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \\nand told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\\nthat something is really going on.\" But we didn\\'t go see her, she\\'s a Russian,\\nshe lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o\\'clock I \\ntell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it\\'s time for you to go, it\\'s late already, I\\'ll see \\nyou out.\" Mamma says, \"You don\\'t need to go, it\\'s too late already, you can \\nsee what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \\nready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \\ntable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \\nout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we\\'re eating.\\nWe turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \\nWe cleared the table.\\n\\nWe hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can\\'t \\nsee what\\'s going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\\nstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \\n. . . I can\\'t figure out what\\'s happening. They\\'re shouting something, looking\\nsomewhere, I can\\'t make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she\\'s \\nan Azerbaijani; we\\'ve been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\\nto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \\nbuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \\npeople, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \\nseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\\nthat means it\\'s not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they\\'re not \\nkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \\nthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \\nfeet, everyone\\'s kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \\ngeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can\\'t speak\\n. . . Well, they\\'ve probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\\nIf each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\\nand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn\\'t see if he\\ngot up and left or not.\\n\\nI become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don\\'t go anywhere, stay at our\\nplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \\nruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \\nstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \\nare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \\nshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \\nturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \\nkept them from coming in. There\\'s only one entryway there, they could stop \\nthem.\\n\\nThey all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\\nafraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \\nwindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \\nand it\\'s packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don\\'t \\ncrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It\\'s just a huge\\ncloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \\nSargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \\ntramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \\ndin and roar. It\\'s incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \\nshouting Father\\'s name, \"Grisha, open the door, we\\'ve come to kill you!,\" or\\nsomething like that. I don\\'t remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \\nsays, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \\nof our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won\\'t come in there, \\nthey\\'ll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We\\'ll tell them \\nthat we live alone here.\" I can\\'t imagine that my parents will stand out in \\nthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \\nthat I\\'ll stand together with them, I\\'ll talk with them if they come, maybe I \\ncan find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \\nAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\\nLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can\\'t remember if I told \\nher anything or not.\\n\\nThen . . . they open the door: it\\'s like they blew on it and it broke and fell\\nright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\\nleave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\\ntell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\\nhas happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \\nsay, \"OK. Go downstairs. We\\'ll gather everything we need and leave the \\napartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\\nthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\\ndoorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\\nToo bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\\npacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \\ncommanding them: \"Don\\'t you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\\n\\nAnd that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\\nroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \\nundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \\nin front of Mamma. I don\\'t remember where they went, what they did, or how \\nmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\\nand tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don\\'t even know what I said. The \\natrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \\nthemselves who would go first.\\n\\nLater, I remember, I came to. I don\\'t know if I\\'m dead or alive. Someone comes\\nin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \\nHe looks around at what\\'s happening. At that instant everything stops. It \\nseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\\ndepends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we\\'re done here.\" They are beating\\nMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \\n. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she\\'s dead. Papa . . . was\\nout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can\\'t get the \\nwindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \\nwindows can\\'t be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \\nabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She\\'s not a real strong \\nperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I\\'m saying something, that\\nI\\'m still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \\nwhich is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \\ndon\\'t get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I\\'m dead, why would I \\nhumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that\\'s what I think, since my\\ntongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \\n. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\\n\\nI no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don\\'t \\nknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \\nmy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \\nsomething metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\\nelse is pinching me . . .I don\\'t even know. I think, my God, when will death \\ncome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\\nthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \\nhappened after that, how many people there were, I don\\'t remember.\\n \\nI come to after a while, I don\\'t remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \\nclothing. I\\'m entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \\nthat I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \\nwhat have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can\\'t make \\nsense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\\nserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \\nwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \\ncourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors\\', even though \\nhe\\'s small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \\nserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\\nthere, I think; now he\\'s stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \\nbrought me to the neighbors\\', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \\n\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I\\'m not one of them.\" How do I know who\\'s who \\nand what\\'s what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\\nPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \\nthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \\nsaid that she was Russian, they said, we\\'ll let you go, we aren\\'t touching the\\nRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she\\'s going \\nto tell them she\\'s Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina\\'s and Lyuda\\'s \\nhands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \\nsister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor\\'s and starts pounding \\non the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \\nthere. So they survived.\\n\\nMy sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\\nWhile they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \\nup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \\nthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \\nit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor\\'s on the fourth floor, the\\none whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \\nknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I\\'m not going to let you \\nin the apartment because I\\'m afraid of them. But I\\'ll give you some stockings \\nand we\\'ll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I\\'ll stay at your place because of\\nwhat\\'s going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \\nmoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn\\'t consent. Lyuda came \\nback to our place and lay under the bed . . .\\n\\nI came to. Mother was there. I can\\'t remember my supervisor\\'s telephone \\nnumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \\ncame to get us. He didn\\'t have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \\nsimply afraid, he didn\\'t know that they were killing us and that we had passed\\nbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\\nThere they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \\nit was hard to breathe . . .\\n\\nMy supervisor\\'s name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He\\'s the head of our \\nadministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\\nof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \\npassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \\nafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \\ngreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\\nwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \\nonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \\nwithout stopping. After us.\\n\\nI think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\\nBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\\nfrom Building 16, that\\'s the building in front of ours. There young \\nAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn\\'t let it into their building. \\nIncidentally, when we were at the neighbors\\', Marina called our relatives\\nto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \\nMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\\nquickly, I can\\'t explain what\\'s going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\\nalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis\\', ones who won\\'t give you away.\" At that moment \\nthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\\nawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \\nthere was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \\nout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\\nwas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\\nnormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \\nscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \\nhere, haven\\'t you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \\nthe soldiers said, \"Don\\'t scream at us. We\\'re Muslims, but we\\'re not from the \\nSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the \\nDaghestan police were there.\\n\\nWhen we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\\nthere were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don\\'t know,\\nmaybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \\ninjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don\\'t know what they \\nwere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \\nand me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don\\'t \\nknow what to do with the rest.\"\\n\\nSo they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \\nboss said, \"Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\\nwhat happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\\nhead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \\nexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \\nambulances hadn\\'t done anything, they didn\\'t respond to any calls. People \\ncalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\\n\\nThat doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\\nvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \\n\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \\nsays, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don\\'t know what your people have been\\ndoing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \\nwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don\\'t I just die so as not to\\nhave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \\ncondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn\\'t \\nhave the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \\nthink of something that yours haven\\'t already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\\nbrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \\nown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \\nmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn\\'t do anything to help us. This\\nwas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn\\'t do anything \\nmore than examine me, that was it. I didn\\'t want any shots or tranquilizer, \\nnothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn\\'t even want to look at \\nthem.\\n\\nI lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\\npose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\\nsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\\nwas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \\nyour brother what happened, there\\'s no point in asking me, your brother can \\nbetter explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \\nthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\\nward.\\n\\nThen people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \\nclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \\nbut the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \\nabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can\\'t believe you put on such a\\nshort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \\nward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \\nbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \\ncouldn\\'t take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\\nthat I couldn\\'t take the apples, and really didn\\'t have any appetite. No one \\nhad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \\nThen I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \\nbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \\nArmenian, maybe they wouldn\\'t figure it out from looking at me. So they must \\nhave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \\nelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\\nthe street, I don\\'t know. In any case, I didn\\'t sleep a wink that night.\\n\\nThe next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \\nand off we went. I didn\\'t even know where they were taking me. They took me to\\nthe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\\nI got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \\ntroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \\na few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \\nthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \\nafter that night. I still didn\\'t know what happened to my parents, they didn\\'t \\ncome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \\nI didn\\'t know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \\nme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \\na lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \\nother and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \\nsee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \\ninterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \\ncould. Of course I\\'m most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \\nwho didn\\'t lose his presence of mind and who didn\\'t change his opinions, \\nneither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \\nhappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \\n. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \\nnot from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \\nof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\\nwith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\\nmyself I couldn\\'t get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\\nlungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \\nlay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \\nfrom all the blows, I don\\'t know. They didn\\'t diagnose anything in particular.\\nWhen I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \\ninsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \\nThere was no way something inside wasn\\'t broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \\nme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \\nemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina\\'s \\nfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children\\'s Clinic. \\nThey had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\\nneeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\\nbreathing, I couldn\\'t seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\\nThey put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\\npeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\\nbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\\nwasn\\'t cut.\\n\\nThey took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \\nappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \\ntalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \\ndemand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It\\'s Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \\nis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \\n\"We\\'ll only see Seidov\\'s daughter, have her come here, we\\'ll do the same \\nthings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we\\'ll deal with you \\nagitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \\nwent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \\nout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \\nthey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \\nsmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \\nhad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \\nclub that didn\\'t even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \\nto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \\nsomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\\nEverything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \\ntheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn\\'t sit or lie down, it \\nwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \\ntook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \\nYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \\nmention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \\nright and left. I just don\\'t know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \\nthe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \\nwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \\nany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \\ntogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \\ntheater and there wouldn\\'t be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \\nthe attic. I didn\\'t see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \\ncouldn\\'t get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \\nthey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\\ntheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn\\'t. I was in no condition to open my \\neyes.\\n\\nEveryone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren\\'t you an \\nAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you\\'re an Azerbaijani.\" They\\nled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\\npassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\\nnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \\nnothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\\nthey should have, with their IDs.\\n\\nSo on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\\nMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn\\'t \\nspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\\nthey burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \\nthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\\nin-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \\nthe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \\nshe ran away, the neighbors wouldn\\'t take her in, so she ran about the \\nbuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \\nThis all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \\nalready in the city.\\n\\nThey murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \\nfamilies. They say they didn\\'t even know for sure if the people were Armenians\\nor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I\\'m not sure myself, I didn\\'t \\nsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it\\'s very difficult \\nnow to say exactly who died and who didn\\'t. It was very difficult to identify \\nthe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\\ngasoline and burned . . . it\\'s all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \\nthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \\nincluding a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\\nMicrodistrict 3.\\n\\nThey were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \\nhad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \\ngoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \\nsavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \\nwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \\nhoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\\nout and killed them on the spot. I didn\\'t see it myself, but I heard that they\\nput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \\nthe corpses, well you can\\'t call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \\nashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\\nG., if I\\'m not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \\nshe still can\\'t figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \\nbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \\nwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \\ncarried her to the city. I still can\\'t imagine how he managed to do that.\\n\\nI heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \\npeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \\nsong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \\nthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \\nthe one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \\ncouldn\\'t find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone\\'s apartment and\\ncalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\\nshe couldn\\'t remember anyone\\'s face.\\n\\nI think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \\ntalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\\nout of my head. I can\\'t remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\\nthe Secretary of the Directorate\\'s Party organization, where Marina works. She\\ngoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\\nthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I\\'m the \\nSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \\nwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \\nmeetings. I know them all, I\\'ve even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\\nArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \\nthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\\n\\nThey took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\\nProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\\ntified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\\nshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they\\'re working on our\\ncase, but I can\\'t even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\\nthe ones, they\\'re processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\\nsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \\ndragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \\nme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \\npeople, all of them, as much as I\\'ve heard about them and seen them, they were\\nall from Kafan.\\n\\nThe Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \\nthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn\\'t \\nrecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\\nI told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away \\nand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn\\'t see Marina \\nanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn\\'t make out \\nanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \\nmyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \\nthere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \\nname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \\nwe\\'re part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"If\\nhe\\'s here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \\nalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I\\'m crazy, not \\nresponsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, \\nmyself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back \\nagain and says something entirely different: \"I wasn\\'t at home, my family and \\nI went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\\ndifferent before.\" After that I didn\\'t go to see our Procurator, our case is \\nbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \\nthat Rzayev\\'s case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \\nWhat are they doing with Rzayev?\\nDid he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \\nhead I can\\'t say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \\ninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn\\'t have to pay for it, but at the \\nsame time\\n\\nI\\'m afraid to say I\\'m a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\\nter who I name, they tell me, no, you\\'re wrong, he didn\\'t do that, that one\\nwasn\\'t there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\\nexactly I can\\'t say.                                                     \\n\\nWhen they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn\\'t see it, \\nbecause I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\\nit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \\nalways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \\nface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \\nthey took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\\nworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \\nis where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \\ndormitory is over there, that\\'s where he lives. Now he\\'s in custody, they even\\nhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\\nclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \\nbuilding was killed, it was that man.\\n\\nA guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\\nhe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn\\'t come \\nover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \\nall over, people started making announcements in town saying that \\ninvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \\nthey\\'ve caught him, everything\\'s been proved. Now, evidently, they\\'ve been\\nbeating him, I don\\'t know what they\\'re doing with them over there, but he \\nhimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \\ncame to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \\nbus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\\nwent. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\\nnight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \\nyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \\nprobably, in their hearts they were thinking, I\\'m going to go. But they didn\\'t\\nsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \\nbecause he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \\nkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \\nthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \\nthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\\n\\nI\\'ve participated in the investigation a couple of times. I\\'m satisfied with\\nthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \\nI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \\nArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don\\'t know. \\nHis last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \\nMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \\nHis mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \\nKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \\nphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \\ncurfew, and I\\'ve got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \\nthe guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\\nand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \\nhaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \\nis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don\\'t know what he did, \\nI can\\'t remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \\nAt the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there\\'s no need for this, \\nall this stuff, look me in the eyes, you\\'re like a sister to me. I took a look\\nat him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \\nyou.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \\nwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \\nshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\\nthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\\nbalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \\nall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \\nThey stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \\nmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \\nfaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \\napartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I\\'ve got three kids and \\nno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn\\'t have \\nanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \\napartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \\napartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That\\'s what they said. How did they \\nknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\\nArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \\nbuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \\nlived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn\\'t set fire to our \\napartment.\\n\\nI don\\'t know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \\nwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\\nhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\\nprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\\nthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\\na free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\\nbeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\\nbeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \\nour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we \\nsaw all of it, how could it happen?\" They\\'re asking me! Well I just don\\'t know\\nwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \\nme. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn\\'t have been \\nable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \\nwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \\nwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \\nArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\\nbalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \\ncame down to the entryway and said, \"You\\'ll come in this entryway over my dead\\nbody.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \\nfolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn\\'t \\neven know what they were doing. I don\\'t think that\\'s true. They knew very well\\nwhat they were doing if they didn\\'t even lift a hand against that woman. They \\ncouldn\\'t have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \\nstopped them.\\n\\nThey were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \\nthey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \\napartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \\nMaybe I\\'m losing my mind? But no, they\\'re all chewing something. Maybe it is \\nsome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \\nto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \\ncome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\\ndidn\\'t talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \\nscreamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we\\'re killing the Armenians!\" \\nOnly they didn\\'t shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun \\nliterally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s how it was! I\\'ll continue. We hid in a captain\\'s apartment, he\\'s an\\nAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \\nkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \\nof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn\\'t find\\nLyuda she took Papa\\'s hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\\nbut they didn\\'t pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\\nthey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\\ncourage to . . .\\n\\nA boy said to my mother \"Where\\'s the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 \\nto 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \\nAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \\nfair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \\nthe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \\nlittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn\\'t really like to \\nwear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \\nbought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\\nthinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \\nMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \\nbound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \\nshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \\ntore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \\ntrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \\nstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \\nto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \\naccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \\n\"What\\'s happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and \\nfind out what\\'s happening to my daughters, even if they\\'ve burned them or \\nmurdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that \\nmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \\nsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn\\'t get out \\nfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \\nshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \\nherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \\nunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\\nher mind. I\\'ll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \\nway to me, I\\'ll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \\ndown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\\noutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don\\'t remember what order it\\nhappened in.\\n\\nAnd Mamma said, \"Listen, they\\'re all running around down there, shouting \\nsomething or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or \\nless calmed down where we were. Who\\'s dead, who\\'s alive, we don\\'t know. I \\ntried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;\\nlet\\'s go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don\\'t know how \\nlong we\\'ll be here. Maybe they didn\\'t burn everything.\" I don\\'t get it, all\\nwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \\nnot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that \\nfor? To hell with it! We\\'re alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" She\\nsays, \"No, let\\'s go get at least something. Maybe we\\'ll leave here, spend the \\nnight at someone else\\'s.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\\nAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \\ncoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \\nshouts, \"Come back, they\\'re coming!\" They didn\\'t have enough time to get a \\nlot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \\nknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\\nout of the hall . . . Someone took Father\\'s old coveralls. The neighbor, his \\nwife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \\nleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\\njust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \\nthey\\'re dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \\nmaybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\\nthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \\nbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \\nor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\\n\\nLater there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\\napartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\\nAsya Dallakian. She\\'s an old woman, retired. She wasn\\'t at home, at that\\ntime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\\nher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\\nretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\\npounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \\nsomething like that, she\\'s a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \\nlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \\nmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \\nThey started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My \\nGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the \\nlights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren\\'t afraid, the ones who \\nknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn\\'t know, but \\nthey didn\\'t come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \\nhe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \\napartment. His last name was Kasumov. He\\'s an exserviceman, retired, works up \\nat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\\nThey tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don\\'t worry, we won\\'t harm you, you\\'re one of\\nus.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren\\'t you taking anything from this \\napartment?\" He says, \"I don\\'t need anything.\" And the women who were standing \\nin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \\nstanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \\nfirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \\nto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \\npillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \\nmad, and he says, \"Where\\'s the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \\n\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in that\\ndirection.\\n\\nOh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \\nthere were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \\njust didn\\'t tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \\nshe didn\\'t want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \\nme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \\nthe ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where\\'s the girl who was here?\"\\nAnd he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn\\'t\\nknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\\ncomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\\ncame to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \\nwhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \\nflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \\nstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \\nto get me. Then one of them said, \"There\\'s so much water down there, she \\nprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \\nthe basement. That\\'s it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn\\'t know that, and \\nwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn\\'t \\njust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\\n\\nAfter that we of course didn\\'t want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \\ndidn\\'t want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \\nstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \\nAlthough the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \\nwho sat in their apartments and didn\\'t help us at a time like that. I think \\nthat they could have helped! I don\\'t think that they were obligated to, but \\nthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \\nbrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\\nenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you\\'re doing?\" That\\'s \\nall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \\none person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \\nstanding on their balconies I didn\\'t hear anyone\\'s voice, no one said what are\\nyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \\nthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\\nbomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \\none of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \\nan old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \\nif a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \\nto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\\nstomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\\nyou want to go on living, you\\'ll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\\nThat trick didn\\'t work on them.\\n\\nEven the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \\nthat it happened. I said I\\'d only forget it if I told them right then that it\\nhad happened to their daughter--and if that didn\\'t have any effect on them, \\nthen I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \\nAnd no one did anything.

As director of FREE\\nINDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering\\ndiscontented gays and lesbians \"a way out of the homosexual death-style\"\\nthrough prayer.  \"I\\'d like to give the award back,\" Caligiuri now laughs, \"I\\'m\\nno longer deserve it.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s eight year involvement with the national \"ex-gay\" movement peaked\\nwith his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well\\nas Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-\\ngay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \"There\\'s no reality\\nin it,\" he says, \"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\"\\n  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the\\norganizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again\\nChristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who\\nare just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their\\nsexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \"We offer support to people who are\\nseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\" explains Bob Davies, director of\\nExodus.  He ventures that \"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-\\nsexuality are men.\"\\n  \"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting\\ntheir time,\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \"redeemed lesbian\" who worked with\\nCaligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \"These\\norganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\"\\n  \"It\\'s possible to change your identity or your behavior,\" says sex educator\\nBrian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \"But it\\'s really impossible to\\nchange your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,\\nbut they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\"\\n  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all\\nhell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both\\ntheir romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted\\nby a man he picked up in a bar.  \"I was really drunk,\" he recalls, \"and I\\nwent home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all\\nnight, and the next morning he raped me again.\"\\n  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the\\nhome he shared with his ex-lover.  \"He had another man there with him,\"\\nCaligiuri recalls.  \"I thought at this time, \\'If this is what being gay is\\nabout, I don\\'t want to be this way anymore.\"\\n  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery\\nwith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix\\'s\\ngay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its\\nfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,\\nFree Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed\\nfor hell.\\n  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks\\nin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \"We were listed\\nunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\" Caligiuri says, \"so people\\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\\nwhere the local bars were, and we\\'d preach to them about the sins of homo-\\nsexuality.\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,\\nadding, \"They\\'ll do anything to reach these people.\"\\n  \"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\" recalls Peter\\nKelly, a counselor at Phoenix\\'s Catholic diocese AIDS program, \"like that\\nhe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on\\nRaphael\\'s syndicated talk show in 1985.  \"They were relieved,\" he recalls.\\n\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better\\nthat I should be a \\'reformed\\' gay person.\"\\n  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \"By the time I appeared on Sally\\'s\\nshow,\" \"I\\'d started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\\nfather.  I was horny all the time.\"\\n  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his\\nnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \"used to go to bookstores\\nand get blowjobs.\"  When he wasn\\'t working the bookstores, he was sleeping\\nwith other \"reformed\" homosexuals.\\n  \"I didn\\'t realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex\\nwith one another,\" Caligiuri says.  \"We\\'d go to conferences in other cities,\\nand we\\'d be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody\\nelse.\"\\n  By the time he appeared on \\'AM Philadelphia\\' television show in May 1988,\\nCaligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show\\'s\\nhost asked him if he ever \"acted on temptation,\" his answer was a lie.\\n  Caligiuri\\'s duplicity began to take it\\'s toll on him, however.  He was\\nsuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating\\nyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \"I was too sick\\nto go to church,\" he explains.  \"The more time I spent away from those people\\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\"\\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local\\nchurch and closed the ministry\\'s doors.  \"I\\'d convinced myself that there\\nis no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says.\\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\"I\\'m interest-\\ned in belief systems that aren\\'t judgemental.\"), considering romance (\"But\\nnot with a CHristian!\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.\\n\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says.  \"I want to\\neventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\\nmay have brought to our community.\"\\n\\n---end article---\\n\\nCaligiuri\\'s tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles\\nof former leaders and founders of \\'ex-gay\\' ministries who have said very similar th\\nsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have\\ncome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,\\nlike Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \"Lazarus Project\" of West\\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community\\nto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values\\nof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become\\nand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \"Love In\\nAction\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \"reformed\" or who\\nwere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed\\nin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \"sealing\" their\\nnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses\\nand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of\\nnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \"sin\"\\nthrough a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch\\nhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-\\ncent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet\\nthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow\\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also\\nmrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and\\nfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on\\nthem, they may even opt for \\'suicide\\' or surgical dampering of the brain\\nfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-\\nplace.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the\\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington\\'s\\n_\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact\\nbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as\\nMaury Johnston\\'s _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser\\'s _Come Hom!_.  I\\nseriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and\\nself-acceptance.', '\\n\\nI think the passage you\\'re looking for is the following.\\n\\nMatthew 5:17    \"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the \\nprophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. \\nMatthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, \\nnot an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. \\nMatthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments \\nand teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he \\nwho does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of \\nheaven. \\nMatthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of \\nthe scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. \\n\\nThere are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the\\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus\\' death was what to do\\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\\nimpose the Law on them didn\\'t say that the Law was abolished.  It\\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  This\\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\\nin Acts 15.)\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent\\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of\\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\\nissue isn\\'t one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\\nassures us that that\\'s not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an impossible standard, and one that\\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s\\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s important that it not be\\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not the end -- ultimately we\\nlive in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.

But they only did what any other conquering race would have done\\n(ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the\\npresent generation who didn\\'t participate in the crimes? Would it do \\nany good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped\\nhundreds, even thousands, of years ago. \\n\\tMy opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let\\'s change\\nthem.

Don\\'t you think they \\nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?\\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \\nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. \\n\\n\\nIf you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),\\nthen the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where\\nthe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to\\narchival material - most people on the net are not.\\n\\n\\nEh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so\\nthat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis\\nmight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\\n\\nI don\\'t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser\\'s friends\\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \\nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\\'s homosexuality.\\n\\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \\npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \\nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \\nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \\nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \"evils\" of homosexuality.\\nWhy should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all \\nsocieties - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.\\n\\nNo, I don\\'t have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you\\nwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access \\nto these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don\\'t have the time. Nothing is\\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources.

This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \"verbatim \\ntranslation\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --\\nthe book they\\'re talking about -- they compare the two things section\\nby section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.\\nIn the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce \\nthe German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not \\nsurprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a \\nsingle idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi\\nlaw; and sure enough, that\\'s what the whole thing has mutated into, \\nurban-folklore style.\\n\\n2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a \\ncopy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution \\nteam or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don\\'t \\nunderstand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable \\nto imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and \\nyet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:\\n\\n\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons\\nLaw during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of\\ndocuments, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German\\nlaw registry].\"\\n\\nBingo.  Exactly.  \\n\\nDodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one\\nunder discussion.  All of the stuff about \"Why would a U.S. congressman\\nhave a copy of a Nazi law?\" melts away, by the author\\'s admission.  He\\nthen continues:  \"But if he acquired the original German text of the \\nNazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so \\nfor a very specific reason...\"  But there\\'s absolutely no reason to \\nthink that this is the case.  In fact, as a \"senior member of the U.S. \\nteam that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\", it seems to me that\\nhe would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether \\nthe Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously\\nis, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally\\nprosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red \\nherrings.\\n\\n3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the\\nJPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he \\nasked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge \\nlevelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask \\nto have things translated when they *don\\'t know what they mean*.  If Dodd \\ntook it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing \\nit into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, \\nwouldn\\'t he?\\n    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier\\nposting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this\\npurpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent\\non disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil\\nliberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn\\'t they have any idea how to do it\\non their own?\\n    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his\\nown question: \"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law\\nto show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the \\nNazi law.\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered\\ninto the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \"concerning\\nthe history of Nazism and gun confiscation\", Dodd\\'s motivation isn\\'t a \\nmystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.\\n\\n4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that\\nwas added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  \\nRegistration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT\\na \"Nazi-inspired\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the \\n1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification \\nof certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list \\nother parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;\\nof course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,\\nin a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the \\ndiscussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, \\n\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA\\'68...\" -- so \\nas to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.', 'Hmmm...I also heard through the grapevine that Team Finland might try and\\nleave a spot open for at least one NHLer.

Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot\\n     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years.\\n     Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL!

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike \\nWhitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh \\nInternational Airport and with me is the President of the United \\nStates Bill Clinton.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk \\nabout in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just \\nbreaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been \\nkind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in \\nthe trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard \\nthat two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and \\nOfficer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been \\nfound not guilty.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's a situation that's been building for over a \\nyear since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  \\nAnd I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see \\nthe situation in Los Angeles in connection with your \\nadministration and what you're trying to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the \\nAmerican people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a \\ntribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the \\nefforts of the federal government in developing the case.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The law under which the officers were tried is a \\ncomplex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury \\ndecided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible \\nfor supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did \\nmost of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked \\nRodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some \\nblows, and another officer who was a rookie.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but \\nit appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They \\nacknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think \\nthat the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But \\nI hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  \\nfirst of all, the importance of trying to bring this country \\ntogether and not violate the civil rights of any American; \\nsecondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think it's important to recognize that in the \\npoorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this \\ncountry, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're \\neven more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our \\nefforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police \\nofficers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a \\nwaiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some \\nother things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to \\nviolence and drugs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to \\nme that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic \\nrevitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed \\nareas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles \\nwho wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many \\nproblems as we do.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the \\ncampaign to try to bring private investment and public investment \\nto bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, \\nRon Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies \\nfor that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest \\nunemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the \\ncountry.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to \\nthe new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several \\nother people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with \\nregard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Let's talk about what brings you to the \\nPittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a \\nlot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  \\nYou've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you \\nsaid earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break \\nthat gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to \\nAllegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that \\nbattle?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First \\nof all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported \\nme in the last election because they wanted a new direction in \\neconomic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it \\ngives the country a very different budget for the next five years \\nthan we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, \\nat the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and \\nhealth care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the \\nshort run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money \\nto create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; \\nto try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also \\nto try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The \\nplan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the \\nSenate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a \\nbloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come \\nto a vote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote \\nfor the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican \\nleader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to \\nstay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases \\nthe deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending \\ntargets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for \\nthis year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five \\nyears.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the \\neconomy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that \\nare holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for \\nbillions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --\\nmuch of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  \\nI've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I \\nthink that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work \\nright now to show that we're changing the direction of the \\ncountry.  And that's the purpose of the bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or \\nhis office lately?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk \\nregularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison \\noperation to the senators that we think are open to this --\\nSenator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords \\nfrom Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six \\nothers whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and \\nknow that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life \\nof the budget I presented.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've \\ngot a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth \\nis that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life \\nof the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we \\nhave this program well below the spending targets that Congress \\nhas already approved for this year.  And they've done this for \\nyears, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans \\nvoting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as \\nputting the American people back to work.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political \\nissue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and \\nthe need for jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I have some questions from people who supported \\nyou, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  \\nIt has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot \\nof people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I \\nthink some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the \\nWhite House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go \\nthrough.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And \\nthey're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull \\nit off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew \\nit was going to be like this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask \\npeople, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving \\nvery fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the \\nfastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in \\nhistory, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we \\nare moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on \\npolitical reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole \\nwide range of things.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn \\nit around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions \\nwhich led to the victory I received from the people in November, \\nand we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making \\nreal, real progress.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  \\nWe're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going \\nto happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing \\nthings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Thank you very much.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, \\nhere live at Pittsburgh International Airport.

(There\\'s a gripe in the industry\\nthat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it\\'s\\nmore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system\\nas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  \\n\\n       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\\nusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\\nway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\\nrather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal \\npollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  \\n\\n       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.

EDT\\n\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, \\ntwo months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our \\nnational deficit and to increase our investment in the American \\npeople, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget \\nplan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \\nand opportunity in the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \\nwhich would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \\nthe House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support \\nof a majority of the United States Senate. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \\nthe economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \\nfast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \\nUnfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \\nhave used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \\nthe will of the majority on the jobs bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \\nstate and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \\nis not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \\nfor full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \\ncare about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \\nthe rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \\ntable and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \\ndignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \\nfamilies and drawing a paycheck.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \\nserving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \\neconomy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \\nwith the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \\nof the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \\nplan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \\njobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \\nnational needs.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \\nToday I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \\nsize package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \\nthe American people. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \\nwill be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \\nminds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \\nthe need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \\ndramatic rise in violent crime. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \\nadditional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \\nto rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \\nfiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \\nmatching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \\n10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \\ncommunities all across our nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \\nviolent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \\npeople have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \\nhomes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \\nAmerica can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \\ninvestment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \\nthe economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no \\nmistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \\never have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \\nfor their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \\nand tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \\nthat I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \\nrehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the \\nsummer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to \\ntalk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement \\nconcern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \\nto have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \\na brighter and more peaceful future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \\nlaw enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \\nthese communities.  I have always supported community policing not \\nonly because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \\nbut because it cements better relationships between people in law \\nenforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \\nthe chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \\nchances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \\nI promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \\nanother 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \\nyears.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind \\nthe core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the \\njobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if \\nyou will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept \\nthe fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to \\nbuilding our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will \\ncreate real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my \\npart now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want now to give the people who are here with me on \\nthe platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the \\nAmerican people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished \\nAttorney General.\\n  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that \\nthe jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over \\nthe suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional \\ndialogue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --\\nthey wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, \\nI made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's \\na lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- \\npeople have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \\nof the present system on many of our major employers, particularly \\nmany of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the \\nstrength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision \\nthat would even approach that on that or any other kind of general \\ntax.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you personally believe that the American public \\nis ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I \\nmean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I \\nwill say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the \\nbenefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --\\neveryone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you \\nstreamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that \\nthere's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or \\nover-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive \\ncare in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows \\nabsolutely massive savings to the health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The real question is whether you can transfer those \\nsavings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have \\nvirtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I \\nhave no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is \\nthe polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, \\nthey say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an \\naffordable health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I don't think that has anything to do with this \\nstimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first \\nand foremost.  They want that more than anything else.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Now that you've announced your willingness to \\ncompromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of \\nyour package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer \\njobs is one.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the \\nhighway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let \\nme say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime \\nbill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a \\nsupplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think \\nwe need to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the \\nenormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately \\nand disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people \\nwith AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be \\ndone.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the \\nsafety of the public depends on that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I \\ndon't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator \\nMitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole \\ncalled me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call \\nhim back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we \\ndiscussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said \\nthat I would not make any statements about any specifics until at \\nleast they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could \\nreach some accord.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been \\nalready, and let's see if they can talk it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator \\nMitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 \\nmillion, that you want that as part of the package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word \\nfor Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator \\nDole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  \\nBut I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I \\nwanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a \\nreformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even \\nmore focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the \\nAmerican people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly \\nconsistent with that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you.\", '\\n1) How was this testing done, and how many times?

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:\\n\\n   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the\\n   net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in\\n   schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that\\'s really beside\\n   the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?\\n   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as\\n   provided for in canon law.\\n\\nHere\\'s some of the theology involved for the interested.\\n\\nThere is confusion over this issue of the SSPX\\'s \"schism\"; often the\\nbasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:\\n\\n- true obedience\\n- false obedience\\n- disobedience\\n- schism\\n\\nTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2\\nimportant elements involved here for my purposes:\\n\\n1) a command\\n2) the response made to the command\\n\\nAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the\\nPope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be\\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\\n\\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\\n\\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\\n\\ncommand         response            name\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\\n\\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\\n\\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of\\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\\nconsider someone\\'s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\\n\"obedient\" or \"disobedient\".  You also have to take into consideration\\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\\n\\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren\\'t being disobedient at all!\\n\\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that\\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them \"disobedient\".  You\\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of\\ncourse disagreed.\\n\\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\\n\\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of\\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You\\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\\n\\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some\\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,\\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they\\'re wrong.  In fact, if\\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very\\nleast, they\\'re wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\\nbadly.\\n\\nSchism... let\\'s move on to schism.  What is it?\\n\\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\\ncommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it\\'s a superset, so\\nit doesn\\'t work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\\nschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don\\'t comply with\\nthe Holy Father\\'s desires doesn\\'t make them schismatics.\\n\\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\\n\\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any\\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that\\'s what you\\'ll find:\\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\\ncommand.\\n\\nHere\\'s what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\\n\\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\\n    (from the CE article \"Schism\")\\n\\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every\\nday.  And that\\'s all that matters as far as schism goes.\\n\\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\\nschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\\n\\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\\nHoly Father\\'s motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", you can find out.  It\\'s the\\ndefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically\\nPapal act.  It\\'s not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It\\'s from the Pope\\nhimself.  His boss is God... there\\'s no one else to complain to.\\n\\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\\n\\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\\nconstituted a schismatic act.\\n\\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre\\'s problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\\nof Tradtion.\\n\\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope\\'s points.\\n\\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine \"Si Si No No\".  It\\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal\\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope\\'s jurisdiction, then they\\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\\nunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is\\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power\\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be\\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\\nPope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\\nanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\\n\\nThe \"Si Si No No\" article was interesting in that it posited that the\\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,\\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article\\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can\\'t tell you more.  I believe they\\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\\n\\nThe Pope\\'s thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\\nThere\\'s no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\\ntheology.  So why does the Pope think this?\\n\\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here\\'s\\nthe passage in question:\\n\\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does\\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\\n\\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\\n        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into\\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes\\n        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and\\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\\n        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who\\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\\n\\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to\\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\\n\\n    (Papal motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", 2 July 1988)\\n\\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\\nbe simplified to the following:\\n\\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\\n- I am the Pope.\\n\\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\\nThis is weak, to say the least!\\n\\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\\nArchbishop Lefebvre\\'s concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II\\'s\\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\\n\"justified disobedience\" or even \"obeying God rather than man\".\\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\\n\\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope\\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\\nexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\\nshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\\n\\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it\\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\\ndiscipline?  It\\'s one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It\\'s something else to\\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\\nall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are\\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally\\nit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.\\nWhile they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they\\nhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door\\nto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly\\nobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.\\nThis would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command\\nthat you say defines schism.', \"\\nI will clarify my earlier quote.

If there are no absolutes, shouldn\\'t we conclude that the statement,\\n\"There are no absolutes\" is not absolutely true?

It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \\nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM DESIGN\\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \\ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\\n\\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\\nrelatively short time.\\n\\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \\nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \\nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \\nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\\n\\n\\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \\nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\\nand participate in the management of technology.

Remember from stellar evolution that \\nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\\nM(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,\\nthey don\\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB\\'s) will be in the plane of the\\ngalaxy.  \\n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\\nsuppose you are saying, \"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\\ndisk.\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here\\'s an \\nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \\n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don\\'t work, also.  As I\\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \\nin the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of\\nthese characteristics.

PDT\\n\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you \\ncould probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll \\ngive you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The first is that this is the meeting of the \\nPresidents, so the money that's being promised is government \\nmoney, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the \\ngovernment.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going \\nto be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian \\nbusinesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What \\nare the priorities, because there are several association of \\nRussian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to \\nparticipate in setting up priorities for investment?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know \\nthat polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans \\nare very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls \\nsay that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times \\npublished that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; \\n42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent \\nif it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to \\nsort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not \\nvery enthusiastic?  Thank you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going \\nto be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the \\nanswers.  Just the answers.  Okay.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, \\nit depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, \\nthe funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will \\nobviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be \\ngood risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will \\nbe used to support the privatization of existing public \\nenterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the \\nDemocracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have \\nsome influence over the distribution of.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to your second question, let me say that \\nI would think that there would be people in both countries who \\nwould not feel too warmly toward simply the American government \\ngiving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to \\nthat in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history \\nthere has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That \\nis, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole \\nhistory of America, any kind of aid program has always been \\nunpopular.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is \\nthis is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that \\nthis is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --\\ntrillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments \\nbecause of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in \\nRussia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them \\nworking on a democracy and struggling to get their economies \\ngoing, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it \\npossible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the \\neconomy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and \\ninvestment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce \\nnuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on \\nour side and on the Russian side.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an \\ninvestment for the United States.  This is very much in the \\ninterest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the \\nsecond stage of the program, which I hope to put together next \\nweek, in my view are things that are good for my country and for \\nthe taxpayers and workers of my country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Russia is a very great nation that needs some \\npartnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share \\nher goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view \\nthis as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not \\nwhat it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful \\ninvestment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But \\nthere's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than \\nthe $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier \\nof the Cold War.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, first of all thank you very \\nmuch, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory \\nof the living correspondents, this is the first time an American \\nPresident is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind \\nof a very measured breakthrough.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory \\nremarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief \\nthat you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you \\ntell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to \\nwhat might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification \\nof START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how \\nconfident you are that the United States Congress would be eager \\nto support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions \\ninherited from the Cold War?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of \\nUkraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with \\nregard to the need to proceed to have the other independent \\nstates all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States \\ndevelop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing \\nthat we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of \\nthe Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude \\nour own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that \\nwould provide not only an important economic opportunity for \\nRussia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out \\non our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed \\noff on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and \\nwe agreed to continue to press that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to \\nreassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the \\nForeign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the \\nUnited States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, \\nbut that, in order to do what we need to do together to \\nstrengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States \\nbe fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join \\nthe NPT regime is critical.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     What was the second question?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and \\nCOCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the \\nRepublican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, \\nas soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other \\nrestrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on \\nrelations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies \\nof the Cold War.

Could you formulate in a few words, what is the \\ndifference between you as a personality and your approach -- the \\ndifference between your approach to Russia and the approach of \\nMr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the \\nlast part of your speech?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to \\ncompare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say \\nwhat was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a \\nboy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the \\nmusic and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been \\nthrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music \\nfor more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists \\nand many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know \\nas much as I could about your history.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then \\nthe Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last \\npresidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone \\nin Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. \\nYeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I \\nwas following events there very closely and hoping for the day \\nwhen we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a \\npersonal feeling about Russia.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like \\nmusic very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a \\nmusician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York \\nPhilharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony \\nto the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly \\nthan anyone had ever played it before because it was technically \\nso difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it \\noccurred.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     These are things that have always had a big impact \\non my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever \\nhad the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two \\ncountries become closer partners.

Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\\npitching).

He can field better.\\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won\\'t be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\\n\\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon\\'s tenure was\\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap.

Being a PhD-student at David\\nChaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research\\nin the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.\\n\\nThe report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be\\nretrieved from\\n\\nftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)\\n\\nfrom the directory pub/CWIreports/AA.\\nThe postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.\\n\\n====================================================================\\nABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash\\nsystem based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which\\nlittle use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the\\nfirst to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the\\nrepresentation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are\\nintroduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and\\npayment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier\\nsystems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in\\nboth computation and communication complexity than any such system\\nproposed previously.\\n  \\nAnother important aspect of our system concerns its provability.\\nContrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be\\nmathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we\\nmake one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the\\nability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the\\nDiffie-Hellman problem. \\n  \\nOur system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in\\npreviously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these\\nis that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be\\nincorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has\\nthe important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the\\nfirst place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender\\nafter the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the\\nmost stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,\\nwhich seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.\\nAnother benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have\\nnegligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by\\na simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that\\nprevious solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system\\ncan be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while\\nretaining its computational efficiency.\\n====================================================================\\n\\nCryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!  \\n\\nI made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as\\npossible.

McConkie\\'s views have been controversial\\n(e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\\nor erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\\ndispensation\").

rarely even SEEN Don Cherry and doesn\\'t know\\nanything about him, I don\\'t know whether it is just this area\\n(Pittsburgh) of the USA that is \"deprived\" of his broadcasts or whether\\nhe\\'s a Canadian thing altogether.

I\\nknow he was a coach at one time, and from the volume of posts about him,\\nSOMEONE surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow, but my question\\nis, what is the deal with him?  Secondly, are the comments of his that I\\nread about on the net merely flame bait, or do people actually take him\\nseriously?  I gotta tell you, from what I see, he really sounds like an\\nass.  Let me know - maybe I\\'m missing something.\\n\\n', '\\nI don\\'t think such a Canada is any more \"culturally similar\" to\\nthe United States than England. In terms of laws regarding individual\\nrights, restrictions on police searches, etc... (all closely\\nrelated to crime) Canadian laws parallel England\\'s and differ\\ngreatly from those of the United States.\\n  \\n\\nActually, they do not have \"roughly the same... urban economy\", \\nand extremely different ethnic composition.\\n\\n\\nHowever, if you account for economic and ethnic differences,\\nthe difference disappears completely: Seattle\\'s minorities are\\npredominatly poor, while Vancouver\\'s are middle or upper class.\\nThe rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle,\\nwhile the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three\\ntimes as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver.\\nThe pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not\\none of gun control.\\n\\n\\nThat is a gross distortion: \"Self-defense\" does not mean killing\\nthe attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their \\nattacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that\\n0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every\\ncase you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence\\nwhere the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed.\\n(0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure,\\nbased on the National Crime Survey\\'s estimate of 80,000\\ncrimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other \\nstudies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000.\\nThose figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences\\ninvolve killing the attacker.) \\n\\nSo, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000) \\ncases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted\\nin the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in\\ncomparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides\\nmake up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study\\nconsidered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides\\nprevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be\\nclose to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.', 'I have a question about digital communications encryption:\\n\\n\\tThe Fact Sheet mentioned encryption/decryption microcircuitry with \\nspecial \"keys\" for law enforcement for wire tapping purposes.\\n\\n\\tIf I wanted to, couldn\\'t I develop  encryption of my own?

Could some bostonian confirm please?\\n\\nI would love to hear what he thinks of the Clipper scam.\\n\\n~Paul', '\\nYes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws.\\nHowever, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all\\nfive schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against\\nmuslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do\\nnot know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and\\nopen hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know\\nthat\\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\\nby the death penalty.\\n\\nMy understanding is that Khomeini\\'s ruling was not based on the\\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\\nprecedent in the Qur\\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\\n\\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\\n\\n\\nI would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was\\nlevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication\\nof the book. However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\\nlevelled at people, not books.\\n\\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \\nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\\n\\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.', 'Everybody.

Some say that if the two have\\n: publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and\\n: are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective\\n: qualifier) they are married/joined in God\\'s sight.\\n\\nThe way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*\\nmarried, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.\\n\\ne.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall\\nleave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh\\'\\'\\n(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).\\n\\nIf you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the\\nphraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife\\'\\'. This\\nimplies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the\\npoint of intercourse.\\n\\nCompare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary\\nwas pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were\\n*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which\\nrequired a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary\\nand Joseph went to bed together.\\n\\nCompare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is\\ndescribed as the ``bride\\'\\' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes \\nplace when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with\\nJesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will\\ntake place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,\\nbecause it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.\\n\\nIn summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is\\nnot marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the\\npoint when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don\\'t mean to demean the\\ncivil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don\\'t mean to be too pedantic.)\\nHistorically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a\\nmarriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since\\nNapoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I\\'m ready to be\\ncorrected on that point!)\\n\\nThis view obviously raises some questions:\\n\\nWhat about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering\\nmarriage. Are those people also ``married\\'\\'?\\n\\nIf it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary\\nto be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours\\nthe laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep\\ntogether though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-\\nhonouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before\\nactually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and\\nalso to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive\\nto declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)\\n\\n-- \\n\\n-----\\nMichael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)', 'Well, it looks like the folks in soc.religion.islam have loosened up\\na bit and are discussing this topic as well as the banking/interest\\ntopic.

I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\\n\\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\\nprohibitions.\\n\\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\\n\\n\\tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\\n\\t    in the Inquisition.\\n\\n\\tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\\n\\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\\n\\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\\n\\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\\n\\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\\n\\n\\tA.  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\\n\\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\\n\\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\\n\\n\\tB.  Burns me at the stake.\\n\\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\\n\\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor\\'s B,\\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\\nof charges brought against them.)\\n\\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.  The \"conservative\" (I don\\'t think that\\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\\nthe gospel, as if one\\'s theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\\nJesus\\' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\\n\\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\\n\\n\\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\\nthey *aren\\'t* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one\\'s actions.  The Great\\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don\\'t keep YOUR rules.\"\\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \"conservatives\" have\\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\\n\\n\\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\\nIt does not have a QU\\'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\\n\\n\\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\\n\\t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\\n\\t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I\\'ll\\n\\t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\\n\\t there is a huge amount of \"cultural baggage\" involved.]\\n\\nYou are quite right that this is \"goo\" if one is looking for an ethical\\nsystem.\\n\\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?

Take the body, and if\\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\\n\\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\\nwas that scored, much less how.\\n\\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \\nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\\n\\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\\n\\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\\nnext season.\\n\\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\\n\\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\\nNot a tough choice.\\n\\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\\n\\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\\nin years to come.\\n\\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\\n\\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\\n\\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\\n\\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\\n\\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\\n\\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home.

Actions\\n: prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.\\n\\nA good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews\\nsays that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated\\nthrough his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).\\n\\nReading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man\\nbeset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his\\nwife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by\\ncopulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the\\nbasis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of \\nfaith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared\\nAbraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.\\n\\nThis gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through\\nworks, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in\\nperforming works.\\n\\n``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy\\nhe saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy\\nSpirit.''

Eventually things settled down and\\ndefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies\\nwere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.\\nThen Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had\\na chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into\\nhim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno\\nwas a little far from the boards, and Mike \"Mister\" McGeough felt that it\\nwarranted a boarding call at 15:38\\n\\nThe Leafs couldn\\'t get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were\\nvery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.\\n\\nWith time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone\\nand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf\\'s blue line. They were in\\na crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass\\nto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark\\nchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and\\nwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside\\nthe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own\\ngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.\\n\\nThe FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk\\ntripped up Rod Brind\\'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the\\nFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric\\ngloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We\\ncould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove\\nand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was\\nrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal\\nmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where\\nRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,\\nand Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past\\nBobby Clarke\\'s 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at\\n117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.\\n\\nMike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on\\nthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with\\na slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most\\nof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers\\nflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton\\ngot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a\\nhooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood\\'s\\nstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.\\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.\\nBowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski\\ntried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,\\nand just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as\\nnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,\\nbut Soderstrom stoned him.\\n\\nThe FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn\\'t\\nget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.\\n\\nThe FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they\\ndecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a\\nlittle.\\n\\nThe FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the\\nperiod, but couldn\\'t get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making\\nroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros \\n(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)\\nall at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.\\n\\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.\\n\\nAt about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left\\ncircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it\\'s side, and\\nas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards\\nit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the\\nother). Seconds later Rod Brind\\'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the\\nLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom\\nstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through\\nSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept\\naway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was\\nequal and preserved the shutout.\\n\\nRecchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl\\nat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski\\nBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek\\nexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to\\nset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS\\nzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran\\nhis stick across McGill\\'s face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.\\n5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.\\nUpward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got\\na couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!\\nPenalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski\\nand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.\\n\\nSo a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest\\nin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind\\'Amour played catch until\\nHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and\\nblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.\\n\\nThat was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa\\ndid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the\\n3rd. Probably the strongest game I\\'ve seen from the FLYERS since the All Star\\nbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in\\nthe NHL, but he\\'s played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can\\'t\\nremember that he\\'s tied with.\\n\\nNext up it\\'s the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot\\nbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night\\nin Washington would be the official end.\\n\\nFLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points\\nin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6\\ngames to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better\\nthan 5 under in 80).\\n\\nTragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th\\nis 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to\\nlose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS\\nwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie\\nbreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble\\ndown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and\\nfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the\\ngoal for the team to focus on.\\n\\nFLYERS team record watch:\\n\\nEric Lindros:\\n\\n38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points\\n\\n(rookie records)\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nEric Lindros\\t38 1992-93\\t\\tDave Poulin\\t76 1983-84\\nBrian Propp\\t34 1979-80\\t\\tBrian Propp\\t75 1979-80\\nRon Flockhart\\t33 1981-82\\t\\tRon Flockhart\\t72 1981-82\\nDave Poulin\\t31 1983-84\\t\\tEric Lindros\\t67 1992-93\\nBill Barber\\t30 1972-73\\t\\tPelle Eklund\\t66 1985-86\\n\\nMark Recchi:\\n\\n51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.\\n\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nReggie Leach\\t61 1975-76\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t119 1975-76\\nTim Kerr\\t58 1985-86,86-87\\tMark Recchi\\t117 1992-93\\nTim Kerr\\t54 1983-84,84-85\\tBobby Clarke\\t116 1974-75\\nMark Recchi\\t51 1992-93\\t\\tBill Barber\\t112 1975-76\\nRick Macliesh\\t50 1972-73\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t104 1972-73\\nBill Barber\\t50 1975-76\\t\\tRick Macliesh\\t100 1972-73\\nReggie Leach\\t50 1979-80\\n\\nFLYERS career years:\\n\\nPlayer\\t\\tPoints\\tBest Prior Season\\nMark Recchi\\t117\\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\\nRod Brind\\'Amour\\t79\\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\\nGarry Galley\\t58\\t38 (84-85 Kings)\\nBrent Fedyk\\t58\\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\\n\\nThat\\'s all for now...', \"\\nI hope there are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow\\nthe algorithm through to hardware.

I think it was the latter.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don\\'t go to\\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\\nholders in LA don\\'t always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\\ninitial success following Gretzky\\'s arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \\n\\nWhether or not the Kings are a \\'winner\\' is debatable.

The Cryptography \\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \\nevery 21 days.\\n\\n\\nContents:\\n\\n* What is public-key cryptography?\\n* What's RSA?\\n* Is RSA secure?\\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?\\n\\n\\n* What is public-key cryptography?\\n\\n  In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and\\n  decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext\\n  P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some\\n  ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so\\n  that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed\\n  from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.\\n  That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie\\n  and Hellman in 1976.\\n\\n  In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to\\n  send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than\\n  them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,\\n  and you don't have to worry about spies.\\n\\n  This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an\\n  extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,\\n  applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the\\n  mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.\\n\\n* What's RSA?\\n\\n  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and\\n  Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at\\n  RSA.COM. Here's a small example.\\n\\n  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples\\n  (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,\\n  and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We\\n  define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.\\n\\n  Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as\\n  anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair\\n  (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a\\n  secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.\\n\\n* Is RSA secure?\\n\\n  Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.\\n  See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization\\n  algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to\\n  prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that\\n  matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by\\n  ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,\\n  ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to\\n  prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and\\n  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative\\n  results.''\\n\\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\\n\\n  It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra\\n  and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three\\n  weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;\\n  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The\\n  algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a\\n  bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers\\n  n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in\\n  any case.\\n\\n  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple\\n  polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n\\n  log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,\\n  but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100\\n  and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.\\n\\n  Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few\\n  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are\\n  developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from\\n  factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number\\n  field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic\\n  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)\\n\\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?\", 'It was great to hear that UMass is bringing back hockey!  It reminded me that a\\ncouple of years ago there was talk that both Bimidgi (sp?) and Mankato State\\ntrying to upgrade their programs to Div. 1 status.  I also seem to remember\\nthat they had some trouble with new NCAA rule about just who was allowed to\\ncompete at the Div. 1 level.  Was that ever resolved?  Also, I was just\\nwondering if there is ANY college hockey east of Colorado (Alaska excepted).\\nWith the new popularity of hockey on the west coast, I would expect there to\\nbe some interest building at the collegiate levels too.

The people of \\nTurkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never \\nabandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally \\nhopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the\\nparties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole \\nperpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July \\n15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop \\nMakarios.\\n\\nFollowing the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with \\nthe aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right \\ngiven by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently \\nand conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For \\nthose Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island \\nsince 1571. \\n\\nThe release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization\\nof Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the\\n\\'enosis\\' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not\\nforget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks\\nin Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to\\ndestroy the island\\'s independence by annexing it to Greece. Of\\ncourse, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences \\nfor this irresponsible conduct.\\n\\n\\n            THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM\\n\\n2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus\\n\\nIt is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at\\nthe Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched\\nagainst the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat\\nIlhan\\'s  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally\\nkilled in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage\\nGreeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the\\n24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities\\ncommitted during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which\\nhas been converted into a museum.\\n\\nAN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY\\nGREEK TERRORISTS\\n\\nThe date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the\\nGreeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been\\ngoing on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men\\nand children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal\\nArea of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage\\nbloodshed...\\n\\nThe wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a\\nmajor on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,\\nare  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the\\nbathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their\\nhome. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.\\n\\nLet us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by\\nMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded\\nduring the same terrible event.\\n\\n\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan\\nand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.\\nOur neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.\\nAyshe\\'s  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting\\nhaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River\\ndirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.\\nThinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was\\ndangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought\\nwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in\\nthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We\\nwaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing\\nin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her\\narms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.\\nGreeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house\\nwith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard\\nvoices saying, in  Greek, \"You want Taksim eh!\"  and then bullets\\nstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children\\nfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,\\nwho broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I\\nheard one of the Major\\'s children moan, then I fainted.\\n\\nWhen I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and\\nher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the\\nneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what\\nhad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to\\nthe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was\\nbrutally murdered.\\n\\nIn the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying\\n\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\"  I became terrified. I\\nthought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not\\ndead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself\\nunder the double-bed.\\n\\nAn our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My\\nmouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some\\nwater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the\\nbathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I\\noffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who\\nwere all wounded.\\n\\nWe  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o\\'clock in  the morning.  I\\nthought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed\\nto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber\\nand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked\\nas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.\\n\\nThere, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were\\noperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there\\nwere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.\\nAyshe and her daughter.\\n\\nAfter staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to\\nAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months\\ntreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,\\nGreeks arrested me at the Airport.\\n\\nAll  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my\\ndetention.

Those are\\nwhat control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have\\nthe 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:\\n\\n              5 + +    open\\n              6 + +    open             \\n              7 + +    open        \\n              8 + +    open\\n              4 + +    closed\\n              3 + +    closed\\n              2 + +    open\\n              1 + +    open\\n\\n    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.\\nTop to bottom.   +\\'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8\\nselect the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the\\nsecond drive (drive 1).   \\n\\n      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it\\'s a auto-config, and I\\'ll have\\nto look up how to do it... I don\\'t have the big book right here.\\n\\n\\n      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not\\nright.

If it's a choice\\nbetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is\\nonly one rational decision.

How you react\\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\\nhas hostile intent.\\n\\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\\n\\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\\nmotorcycle is capable of.\\n\\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\\n\\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\\n\\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\\npunishment.\", '[deleted]\\nthink:\\n[deleted]\\n                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nLet me first say that \"to believe that no gods exist\" is in fact \\ndifferent than \"not believing in a god or gods\". \\n\\nI will argue that your latter statement, \"I believe that no gods exist\"\\ndoes rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement \\nthat \"no gods exist\" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don\\'t  \\nknow and therefore don\\'t believe in them and don\\'t NOT believe in then\\n(weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \\nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \\nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\\n\\nBut first let me say the following.\\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\\'s rather pointless\\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\\nI\\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it\\'s\\n\\'usual sense\\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\\nGod\".\\n \\nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\\n\\nfaith \\n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\\nb  (1): fidelity to one\\'s promises\\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n   (2): complete trust\\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nof religious beliefs\\nsyn see BELIEF\\n\\n\\n\\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \\npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \\ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \\nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead. Of course \\nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \\nanthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I\\'ll be \\nglad to.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently \\ndisagree - it\\'s in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person \\nthinks I\\'ve misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think \\nI have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my \\nways and I correct the situation.

Neil Smith\\n\\n                           WEIRD SCIENCE\\n\\nEveryone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips \\nmove.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are \\npoliticians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase \\n\"political science\" is subject to more than one interpretation.  \\n\\nYears ago, we heard how \"scientists\" were worried that a new Ice \\nAge might be coming, and later on that \"nuclear winter\" -- smoke \\nand dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international \\nunpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even \\nhave killed the dinosaurs.  \\n\\nWhat we didn\\'t hear was that no actual data supported any of this, \\nthat real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended \\nto discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken \\nvalues that made America the most successful culture in history, \\nand that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague \\nwhen continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.  \\n\\nWe miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William \\nSound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen\\'s weren\\'t \\nsupposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least \\n100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you\\'d never \\nknow it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn\\'t fit \\ntheir agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and \\nthat nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.  \\n\\nBut for once, the media aren\\'t entirely to blame.  As ignorant of \\nscience as they are of everything, they trust \"scientists\" to \\nunscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today\\'s \"scientists\" \\nhave agendas of their own.  \\n\\nNobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is \\ngoing to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that \\nthere is no respectable evidence for \"global warming\".  The money \\nand power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and \\nthey hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical \\ncrisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.  \\n\\nThe same appears true of \"acid rain\", a deliberate hoax cooked up \\nby the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private \\nindustrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and \\nfoisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on \\nspecialists in different fields not talking to each other much.  \\n\\nThe list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.  \\n\"Ozone depletion\", for which evidence is even more suspect and \\ncontradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than \\na last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era \\nwhen state central planning and the command economy have failed and \\ncan only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.  \\n\\nDecades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth \\nand panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear \\npower is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy \\nknown to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount \\nof energy there is available to any individual in society, the \\nfreer that individual -- and his society -- become.  \\n\\nHonest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and \\nself-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as \\nideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive \\nreductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have \\nbeen suppressed, most recently by the California state government.  \\n\\nAnd what the media didn\\'t say about recent EPA \"discoveries\" on the \\neffect of \"secondhand smoking\" is that, although some harm to non-\\nsmokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of \\nmagnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a \\nweek or keeping a pet bird.  It\\'s enough to make you wonder whether \\nthere was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.  \\n\\nThat, of course, is the real threat represented by politically \\ncorrect science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice \\nto know the hazards.  I\\'ve never believed smoking to be a healthy \\npractice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today\\'s \\nscience, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is \\nhighly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet \\nthe stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There \\nisn\\'t any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of \\ngovernment money on the scientific establishment.  \\n\\nTwo centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies \\nto which every other nation in the world has been subject at one \\ntime or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and \\nreligion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has \\ntried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of \\nabortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street \\n-- has wound up being shed.  \\n\\nReal human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people\\'s \\nlives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of \\nlivelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate, \\nto diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels \\nfor electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates, \\nwhen they die from the effects of obesity.  \\n\\nWhat we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two \\nmore centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of \\nstate and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable; \\nreal science won\\'t languish for lack of funding.  The money will \\nsimply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and \\neveryone will benefit.  \\n\\nL.

Like a lot of bosses, he didn\\'t obey his\\nown rules.\"\\n\\tThe documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped\\nwould be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after\\nWorld War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.\\n\\tHimmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than\\n100 German secret police generals.  \"I also want to talk to you,\\nquite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be\\nmentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.\\nI mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish\\nrace.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been\\nwritten and is never to be written.\"  [Emphasis mine--rje]\\n\\tThe German word Himmler uses that is translated as\\n\"extermination\" is *Ausrottung*.\\n\\tWolfe said a more precise translation would be \"extirpation\"\\nor \"tearing up by the roots.\"\\n\\tIn his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism,\\n\"Judenevakuierung\" or \"evacuation of the Jews.\"  But archives\\nofficials said \"extermination\" is the word he actually\\nspoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.\\n\\tHimmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler\\'s \"final solution of the\\nJewish question,\" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.\\n\\tThe National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is\\na preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial\\nMuseum here on April 26.\\n\\tThe National Archives exhibit includes a page each of\\nHimmler\\'s handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and\\nan offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.\\n\\n\\t---From p.A10 of Saturday\\'s L.A.

In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health\\ninsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like\\nsocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary\\ninsurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine\\'s Summer 1992 edition\\nhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,\\nincluding a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,\\nyou\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.\\nWith extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and\\nbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The\\npublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount\\nfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or\\naccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of\\nFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health\\ncosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other\\ntaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures\\nfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure\\nfor the U.S.\\n\\nThat the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund\\nis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back\\nin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health\\ninsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff\\nof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \"libertarian\"\\nfaction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that\\njust a few people have to be reminded that it\\'s not free (the average\\nCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American\\ncounterparts on issues like these).\\n\\nI\\'m one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about\\nleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian\\nnewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, \\'cos the 100%\\ninsurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn\\'t know\\nit, you\\'d believe it actually is socialized medicine (American\\nconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who\\nseriously call it that).  Canadians aren\\'t worried about the\\nAmericans, who spend 14%; we\\'re worried about the French and Germans\\nwho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that\\nshouldn\\'t be paid for out of general funds like physicals for\\ninsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that\\nthe Canadian health insurance hasn\\'t spiralled out of control despite\\nbeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to\\nspend all of your benefits\\' worth, and more if you can ... we\\'re a\\ndifferent culture.\\n\\n\\n\"Managed Care\" relies on HMO\\'s, which are unknown in most western\\nnations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France\\nand Germany (I\\'m Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says\\nof HMO/NHS approaches, \"We left that behind with East Germany!\").\\nSure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling\\ndoctors with budget strings.\\n\\nIn Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France\\nand Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public\\nhospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO\\'s.  The divisions\\nare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked\\n\"sickness funds\" over a century old while Canada divides by their\\nprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the\\ndoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)\\n\\nWith such an open-ended system, it\\'s no surprise that Canada is #2 to\\nthe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go.

The world now has almost 10\\n  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of\\n  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as\\n  dramatically.\\n\\n    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial\\n  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy\\n  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group\\n  of Seven nations.\\n\\n    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil\\n  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the\\n  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,\\n  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the\\n  overall U.S. economy.\\n\\n    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per\\n  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.\\n\\n    Utilities\\' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side\\n  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource\\n  inputs, an competitive inequities.

In concrete terms, this means the\\nmass has become a commercial for God\\'s grace rather than the real\\nthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn\\'t\\ndare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have\\nbeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing\\non _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in\\nliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or\\nthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic\\nexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of\\nthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita\\nbread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered\\nin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but\\nCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this real\\ndesacration of the real symbol of Jesus\\' body.\\n\\nModern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We\\ntry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac\\npriest get up and \\'explain\\' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and\\nstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.\\nIt doesn\\'t help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and\\nthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated\\ntunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the\\ngenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize\\' is only\\nslightly better.\\n\\nWhat are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it\\ndoesn\\'t work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well\\nprepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW\\na matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is\\nthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative\\nliturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean\\nthe Church will be socially conservative.\\n\\nIn NYC I can recommend:\\n\\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St.\\n\\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, \\n\\tSt. Joseph\\'s, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \"clean\", largely gay\\n\\tOratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful\\n\\nAvoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.\\n\\nHappy Easter: Christos Aneste\\', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is Risen', '\\nNewsgroups: rec.audio,misc.forsale\\nDistribution: na\\nSubject: Forsale: Sony D-22 diskman\\n', \"Are you sure you're running in 386-enhanced mode?

It does not go into\\ngreat detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many\\nof the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in\\ngeneral, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM.\\nIt is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It\\nis posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining\\nspecifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.\\n\\nCRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS\\n---------------------\\n\\n- Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,\\n  in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign\\n  messages with your private key.\\n\\n  RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard\\n  cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with\\n  RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a\\n  huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.\\n\\n- Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,\\n  since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow\\n  an attacker to claim to be you.\\n\\n  DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be\\n  compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies\\n  have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each\\n  message has a different DES key, the work for each message would\\n  remain high.\\n\\nKEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS\\n----------------------\\n\\n- Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking\\n  RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived\\n  from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy\\n  of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network\\n  packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.\\n\\n  The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the\\n  private key file across an untrusted link.  So don\\'t do that.  Run \\n  RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of\\n  you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)\\n  which nobody else has physical access to.\\n\\n- Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could \\n  allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him\\n  rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your\\n  intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with\\n  the other bogus public key and pass them along.\\n\\n  It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.\\n  The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent\\n  has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be \\n  given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key\\n  authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is\\n  not always practical.  Having other people \"vouch for you\" by\\n  signing a statement containing your key is possible, although \\n  RIPEM doesn\\'t have features for doing this as automatically as\\n  PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys\\n  in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for\\n  authentication.\\n\\nPLAYBACK ATTACKS\\n----------------\\n\\n- Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could\\n  still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message\\n  with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)\\n  to Alice which says \"OK, let\\'s do that.\" Your opponent intercepts\\n  it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is\\n  authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may\\n  interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent\\n  could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,\\n  figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the\\n  opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register \\n  your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient\\n  will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the\\n  unknown message.\\n\\n  To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should \\n  include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique\\n  identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM\\n  should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be\\n  sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within\\n  the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that\\n  the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be\\n  automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at\\n  automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated\\n  headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in\\n  the utils directory.\\n\\nLOCAL ATTACKS\\n-------------\\n\\n- Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of\\n  the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under\\n  UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,\\n  although it would take some planning and effort to do something like\\n  replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of\\n  the plaintext, depending how it\\'s stored.\\n\\n  In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is\\n  an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine\\n  which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an\\n  eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your\\n  passphrase.)\\n\\n  RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In\\n  the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,\\n  which you have total control over and which nobody else has access\\n  to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of\\n  viruses, and so on.  However, there\\'s a very real trade-off between\\n  convenience and security here.\\n\\n  A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation\\n  where other people have access (even root access), but increase\\n  security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of\\n  course) executable on a floppy disk.\\n\\n  Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing\\n  in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their\\n  own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the\\n  security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since\\n  you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you\\'ve just\\n  given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and\\n  install traps in your account to steal your private key next time\\n  you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the\\n  situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of\\n  cleartext password authentication.\\n\\n  I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my\\n  security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that\\n  potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are\\n  in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not\\n  carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated\\n  with greater care for critical correspondence.\\n\\nUNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS\\n-------------------------\\n\\n- RIPEM\\'s encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key\\n  corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the\\n  traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she\\n  may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There \\n  exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an\\n  ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by\\n  you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this\\n  functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically\\n  states that such transformations should be possible to allow\\n  forwarding functions to work.', \"\\n\\n\\nLindbergh's flight took place in '27, not the thirties.\\n\\n\\nCould you give examples of privately funded ones?\\n\\n\\nYour logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies.  However, the\\nconcept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I \\nsuspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic \\nbenefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for a\\nhuman powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic\\nbenefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed\\nand the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the \\nequivalent amount of direct investment would.

Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk\\nresentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their\\ngood fortune?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America\\nthat is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People\\nand business (government/business \\'partnership\\' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh \\nis the populist nemesis of that movement.\\n\\nI have read Mr. Limbaugh\\'s book, and although it was not the most literary\\npiece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain \"venom\"\\nat all, let alone \"venom\" comparable to an individual who callously murdered\\nmillions out of racism.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA very serious tone in that oratory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show, \\nBTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather\\nthan blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention \\nthat he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions.\\nHe also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be\\nintelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much).\\nThis is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is\\ntreated as society\\'s intellectual lowest common denominator.\\n\\nI am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just\\nkidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany\\'s problems and\\nneeded to be exterminated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since\\nChrist was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler\\'s characterization of\\nthe Aryan as \"the highest image of the Lord\" fits with Christian doctrine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivate religious schools have a vastly better record of success than\\npublicly funded schools.

I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the\\ndepraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control \\nof Hollywood.\\n\\n90\\'s Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control \\nof our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an\\nearly age the \"right\" way to view religion and morality.

It  took him two  years to\\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\\n\\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\\n\\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\\nrepublic\\'s forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic\\'s chief forensic\\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\\n\\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov\\'s\\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\\n\\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov\\'s  investigative  commission  are  still\\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day.

In the last few\\nyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It\\'s\\ndriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is\\nthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to \\ndo it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we \\npresent to God.  But the best Masses I\\'ve been to were participatory prayers.\\n\\nLately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion\\nof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do\\n(which is necessary because no one knows what\\'s happening next) is growing.\\nExample.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually\\non Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking\\nthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say\\n\"Crucify him\" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we\\'d do it\\nagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were \"invited\" to sit\\nduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian \"invitation\", \\nI was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems\\ntypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the\\nmusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the\\nliturgy and since no one knows what\\'s happening, the new things have to be\\nexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we\\'re just\\nsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about\\nto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay\\n\"experts\", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a\\nbias toward doing something rather than nothing--that\\'s just a fact of\\nbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for\\npeople to be aware of the Lord\\'s presence.\\n\\nSo we\\'ve been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass\\ngoing down?  I don\\'t mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or\\nFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware \\nof God\\'s presence.

Apparently the process of expanding\\neach frame's image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate\\nbit depth is pretty processor-intensive. There are optimizers that work\\npretty well for showing movies at double size, but if you drop to 1.9x\\nsize or increase to 2.1x size, performance suffers dramatically.\\n\\n(don't know\\nQuicktime\\n\\nHe lied. :-) Quicktime is very CPU dependent. He was probably confused by\\nthe fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode, and will play in the\\nsame amount of time on any machine. However, an LC will drop frames in\\norder to keep the sound and video synced up.\\n\\nThe Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similar\\nperformance, though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally\\nfaster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture.\\n\\nhaving\\nwas\\n\\nI expect that the version of the Quicktime software you saw was 1.0 -- I\\nwas using was 1.5. One of the new codecs in v1.5 allows video at nearly\\ntwice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle.\\nThe Centris 650 I saw was a plain-vanilla, with the exception of the nice\\nspeakers that were playing the sound, and the software was Movie Player,\\nthe QT player Apple includes with the software.\\n\", 'Here is the OPI (Offensive Production Index) for all AL players with at\\nleast 10 at bats.\\n\\nIt is early in the season so there are some very high numbers.

In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\\n\\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\\nfriend\\'s crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\\nPasteur\\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\\nlacked Pasteur\\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\\n\\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\\ncontained fantasies of becoming the \"Newton of mirror-image life,\" which\\nhe never admitted publically.\\n\\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\\' discoveries in mice.\\nMost of Griffiths\\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\\' work in vitro, which the\\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).', 'o Subaru Service Manuals ................................... $10.00\\n     This is not a complete set, but includes sections 4, 5 \\n     & 6 which cover MECHANICAL COMPONENTS (suspension, wheels \\n     & axles, steering, brakes, pedals & control cables, heater \\n     & ventilator, air conditioning), BODY (body & exterior, \\n     doors & windows, seats, seat belts, interior, instrument \\n     panel), and ELECTRICAL (engine electrical system, body \\n     electrical system, wiring diagram, and trouble-shooting). \\n     These are the genuine Subaru issue manuals.

She was a cheerful\\n    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but\\n    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.\\n\\n    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on\\n    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-\\n    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally\\n    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and\\n    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon\\n    on\\tthe  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love\\n    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to\\n    die rather than commit a mortal sin.\\n\\n    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy\\n    Eucharist.\\tHer  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father\\'s\\n    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the\\trest  of  the\\n    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is\\n    until\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -4-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.\\n    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria\\'s life.\\n\\n    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling\\n    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her\\n    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,\\tMaria\\n    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.\\n    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the\\n    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti\\'s, owning\\n    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other\\n    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she\\n    did the Holy Will of God.\\n\\n    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)\\ttwice\\n    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On\\n    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro\\'s\\n    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she\\n    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria\\tlived\\n    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.\\n\\n\\n    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \"get  a\\n    handkerchief,\"  as\\the  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath\\n    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the\\n    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered\\n    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a\\n    91/2\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told\\n    him she wouldn\\'t go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He\\n    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia\\n    instantly realized what he was up to. \"No, No, No! Do  not\\ttouch\\n    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\" At this point Alessandro\\n    held the knife over Maria\\'s chest, who was now on the floor.\\n\\n    \"Will you or will you not?\" Maria gathered all her energy.\\t\"No I\\n    will  not,\\tAlessandro,  no!\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over\\n    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the\\n    knife  into   Maria\\'s  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to\\n    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the\\n    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying\\n    of the baby Teresa\\ton  the  landing  brought  the\\tattention  to\\n    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended\\n    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find\\n    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.\\n    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \"He\\n    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\"\\n\\n    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro\\taway.\\n    As\\tthe  ambulance\\tcarried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd\\n    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for\\n    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First\\n    Communion\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -5-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.\\n    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \"Yes.  For the\\n    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me\\n    in\\tParadise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\" Maria\\n    died at about three o\\'clock.\\n\\n    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria\\'s  death  but\\n    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in\\n    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-\\n    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of\\n    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to\\n    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God\\'s par-\\n    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony\\n    in\\tMaria\\'s  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,\\n    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the\\n    first mother ever to be present at her daughter\\'s canonisation.\\n\\n    May St. Maria Goretti help\\tus  to\\tbe  pure  and  grant  us  the\\n    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.\\n\\n    Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.\\n\\n\\n    by Brendan Arthur\\n', \"\\n\\n\\nNeither did he!\\n\\n\\nOverall?
