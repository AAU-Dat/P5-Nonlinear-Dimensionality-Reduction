230	It has a prevalence that ranges between 2 and 150 per 100,000 .	0
231	MS was first described in 1868 by Jean-Martin Charcot .	0
232	MS affects the ability of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to communicate with each other effectively .	0
233	Nerve cells communicate by sending electrical signals called action potentials down long fibers called axons , which are contained within an insulating substance called myelin .	0
234	In MS , the body 's own immune system attacks and damages the myelin .	0
235	When myelin is lost , the axons can no longer effectively conduct signals .	0
236	The name multiple sclerosis refers to scars ( sclerae-—better known as plaques or lesions ) particularly in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord , which is mainly composed of myelin .	0
237	Although much is known about the mechanisms involved in the disease process , the cause remains unknown .	0
238	Theories include genetics or infections .	0
239	Different environmental risk factors have also been found .	0
240	Almost any neurological symptom can appear with the disease , and the disease often progresses to physical and cognitive disability .	0
241	MS takes several forms , with new symptoms occurring either in discrete attacks ( relapsing forms ) or accumulating over time ( progressive forms ) .	0
242	Between attacks , symptoms may go away completely , but permanent neurological deficits often occur , especially as the disease advances .	0
243	There is no known cure for multiple sclerosis .	0
244	Treatments attempt to return function after an attack , prevent new attacks , and prevent disability .	0
245	MS medications can have adverse effects or be poorly tolerated , and many people pursue alternative treatments , despite the lack of supporting scientific study .	0
246	The prognosis is difficult to predict ; it depends on the subtype of the disease , the individual 's disease characteristics , the initial symptoms and the degree of disability the person experiences as time advances .	0
247	Life expectancy of people with MS is 5 to 10 years lower than that of the unaffected population .	0
248	Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the Solar System .	1
249	It is a gas giant with mass one-thousandth that of the Sun but is two and a half times the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System combined .	0
250	Jupiter is classified as a gas giant along with Saturn , Uranus and Neptune .	0
251	Together , these four planets are sometimes referred to as the or outer planets .	0
252	The planet was known by astronomers of ancient times , and was associated with the mythology and religious beliefs of many cultures .	0
253	The Romans named the planet after the Roman god Jupiter .	0
254	When viewed from Earth , Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94 , making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus .	0
255	( Mars can briefly match Jupiter 's brightness at certain points in its orbit . )	0
256	Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium , although helium only comprises about a tenth of the number of molecules .	0
257	It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements , but like the other gas giants , Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface .	0
258	Because of its rapid rotation , the planet 's shape is that of an oblate spheroid ( it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator ) .	0
259	The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes , resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries .	0
260	A prominent result is the Great Red Spot , a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope .	0
261	Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere .	0
262	There are also at least 67 moons , including the four large moons called the Galilean moons that were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610 .	0
263	Ganymede , the largest of these moons , has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury .	0
264	Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft , most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter .	0
265	The most recent probe to visit Jupiter was the Pluto -bound New Horizons spacecraft in late February 2007 .	0
266	The probe used the gravity from Jupiter to increase its speed .	0
267	Future targets for exploration in the Jovian system include the possible ice-covered liquid ocean on the moon Europa .	0

287	A teleconverter attached between a camera and its objective	0
288	An Olympus EC-20 - 2x teleconverter lens attached between a camera.1 - Camera lens 2 - Teleconverter 3 - Camera body	0
289	A teleconverter ( sometimes called tele extender ) is a secondary lens which is mounted between the camera and a photographic lens .	0
290	Its job is to enlarge the central part of an image obtained by the objective lens .	0
291	For example , a 2× teleconverter for a 35 mm camera enlarges the central 12×18 mm part of an image to the size of 24×36 mm in the standard 35 mm film format .	0
292	Teleconverters are typically made in 1.4× , 1.7× , 2× and 3× models , of which 1.4× and 2× are most common .	0
293	The use of a 2× teleconverter gives the effect of using a lens with twice the focal length .	0
294	It also decreases the intensity of the light reaching the film by a factor of 4 ( an equivalent of doubling the focal ratio ) as well as the resolution ( by a factor of 2 ) .	0
295	Illustration of a Eukaryotic cell membrane	0
296	The cell membrane is a biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment .	0
297	The cell membrane is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules and controls the movement of substances in and out of cells .	0
298	The basic function of the cell membrane is to protect the cell from its surroundings .	0
299	It consists of the lipid bilayer with embedded proteins .	0
300	Cell membranes are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell adhesion , ion conductivity and cell signaling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures , including the cell wall , glycocalyx , and intracellular cytoskeleton .	0
301	Cell membranes can be artificially reassembled .	0
302	The Late Heavy Bombardment ( commonly referred to as the lunar cataclysm , or LHB ) is a hypothetical event around 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago ( Ga ) .	0
303	During this event a very large number of the impact craters on the Moon would have formed , and by inference on Earth , Mercury , Venus and Mars as well .	1
304	( While the LHB is `` late '' in the Solar System 's accretion period when Earth and the other rocky planets formed and gained most of their mass , it is early in Solar System history . )	0
305	The evidence for this event comes primarily from the dating of lunar samples brought back by the Apollo astronauts , which indicates that most impact melt rocks formed in this rather narrow interval of time .	0
306	While many hypotheses have been put forth to explain a spike in the flux of asteroids or comets in the inner Solar System at this time , no consensus yet exists as to its cause .	0
307	The Nice model , popular among planetary scientists , postulates that the gas giant planets underwent orbital migration and forced objects in the asteroid belt and/or Kuiper belt on eccentric orbits that put them in the path of the terrestrial planets .	0
308	Nevertheless , some researchers argue that the lunar sample data do not require a cataclysmic cratering event near 3.9 Ga , and that the apparent clustering of impact melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling material affected by a single large impact basin .	0

310	Double rainbow and supernumerary rainbows on the inside of the primary arc .	0
311	The shadow of the photographer 's head on the bottom marks the centre of the rainbow circle ( antisolar point ) .	0
312	A rainbow is an optical and meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection of light in water droplets in the Earth 's atmosphere , resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky .	0
313	It takes the form of a multicoloured arc .	0
314	Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the sun .	0
315	In a `` primary rainbow '' , the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side .	0
316	This rainbow is caused by light being refracted while entering a droplet of water , then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it .	0
317	In a double rainbow , a second arc is seen outside the primary arc , and has the order of its colours reversed , red facing toward the other one , in both rainbows .	0
318	This second rainbow is caused by light reflecting twice inside water droplets .	0
319	The Federal Reserve System ( also known as the Federal Reserve , and informally as the Fed ) is the central banking system of the United States .	0
320	It was created on December 23 , 1913 , with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act , largely in response to a series of financial panics , particularly a severe panic in 1907 .	0
321	Over time , the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have expanded and its structure has evolved .	0
322	Events such as the Great Depression were major factors leading to changes in the system .	0
323	The US Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act : Maximum employment , stable prices , and moderate long-term interest rates .	0
324	The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve 's dual mandate .	0
325	Its duties have expanded over the years , and today , according to official Federal Reserve documentation , include conducting the nation 's monetary policy , supervising and regulating banking institutions , maintaining the stability of the financial system and providing financial services to depository institutions , the U.S. government , and foreign official institutions .	1
326	The Fed also conducts research into the economy and releases numerous publications , such as the Beige Book .	0
327	The Federal Reserve System 's structure is composed of the presidentially appointed Board of Governors ( or Federal Reserve Board ) , the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities throughout the nation , numerous privately owned U.S. member banks and various advisory councils .	0
328	The FOMC is the committee responsible for setting monetary policy and consists of all seven members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents , though only five bank presidents vote at any given time ( the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year terms ) .	0
329	The Federal Reserve System has both private and public components , and was designed to serve the interests of both the general public and private bankers .	0
330	The result is a structure that is considered unique among central banks .	0
331	It is also unusual in that an entity outside of the central bank , namely the United States Department of the Treasury , creates the currency used .	0
332	According to the Board of Governors , the Federal Reserve System `` is considered an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government , it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress , and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms . ''	0
333	The authority of the Federal Reserve System is derived from statutes enacted by the U.S. Congress and the System is subject to congressional oversight .	0
334	The members of the Board of Governors , including its chairman and vice-chairman , are chosen by the President and confirmed by the Senate .	0
335	The government also exercises some control over the Federal Reserve by appointing and setting the salaries of the system 's highest-level employees .	0
336	Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of their region ; this entitles them to elect some of the members of the board of the regional Federal Reserve Bank .	0
337	Thus the Federal Reserve system has both public and private aspects .	0
338	The U.S. Government receives all of the system 's annual profits , after a statutory dividend of 6 % on member banks ' capital investment is paid , and an account surplus is maintained .	0
339	In 2010 , the Federal Reserve made a profit of $ 82 billion and transferred $ 79 billion to the U.S. Treasury .	0
340	This was followed at the end of 2011 with a transfer of $ 77 billion in profits to the U.S. Treasury Department .	0

344	Abraham Lincoln ( February 12 , 1809 – April 15 , 1865 ) was the 16th President of the United States , serving from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865 .	0
345	Lincoln led the United States through its greatest constitutional , military , and moral crises—the American Civil War —preserving the Union , abolishing slavery , strengthening the national government and modernizing the economy .	0
346	Reared in a poor family on the western frontier , Lincoln was self-educated , and became a country lawyer , a Whig Party leader , Illinois state legislator during the 1830s , and a one-term member of the United States House of Representatives during the 1840s .	0
347	After a series of debates in 1858 that gave national visibility to his opposition to the expansion of slavery , Lincoln lost a Senate race to his arch-rival , Stephen A. Douglas .	0
348	Lincoln , a moderate from a swing state , secured the Republican Party presidential nomination in 1860 .	0
349	With almost no support in the South , Lincoln swept the North and was elected president in 1860 .	0
350	His election was the signal for seven southern slave states to declare their secession from the Union and form the Confederacy .	0
351	The departure of the Southerners gave Lincoln 's party firm control of Congress , but no formula for compromise or reconciliation was found .	0
352	Lincoln explained in his second inaugural address : `` Both parties deprecated war , but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive , and the other would accept war rather than let it perish , and the war came . ''	0
353	When the North enthusiastically rallied behind the national flag after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter on April 12 , 1861 , Lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war effort .	0
354	His goal was now to reunite the nation .	0
355	As the South was in a state of insurrection , Lincoln exercised his authority to suspend habeas corpus , arresting and temporarily detaining thousands of suspected secessionists without trial .	0
356	Lincoln averted British recognition of the Confederacy by skillfully handling the Trent affair in late 1861 .	0
357	His efforts toward the abolition of slavery include issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 , encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery , and helping push through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which finally freed all slaves nationwide in December 1865 .	0
358	Lincoln closely supervised the war effort , especially the selection of top generals , including commanding general Ulysses S. Grant .	0
359	Lincoln brought leaders of the major factions of his party into his cabinet and pressured them to cooperate .	0
360	Under Lincoln 's leadership , the Union set up a naval blockade that shut down the South 's normal trade , took control of the border slave states at the start of the war , gained control of communications with gunboats on the southern river systems , and tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond , Virginia .	0
361	Each time a general failed , Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded in 1865 .	0
362	An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state , Lincoln reached out to War Democrats and managed his own re-election in the 1864 presidential election .	0
363	As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party , Lincoln found his policies and personality were `` blasted from all sides '' : Radical Republicans demanded harsher treatment of the South , War Democrats desired more compromise , Copperheads despised him , and irreconcilable secessionists plotted his death .	0
364	Politically , Lincoln fought back with patronage , by pitting his opponents against each other , and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory .	0
365	His Gettysburg Address of 1863 became the most quoted speech in American history .	0
366	It was an iconic statement of America 's dedication to the principles of nationalism , republicanism , equal rights , liberty , and democracy .	0
367	At the close of the war , Lincoln held a moderate view of Reconstruction , seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness .	0
368	Six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E. Lee , however , Lincoln was assassinated by actor and Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth .	0
369	Lincoln 's death was the first assassination of a U.S. president and sent the nation into mourning .	0
370	Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as one of the greatest U.S. presidents .	0

375	The Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor is a single-seat , twin-engine fifth-generation supermaneuverable fighter aircraft that uses stealth technology .	0
376	It was designed primarily as an air superiority fighter , but has additional capabilities that include ground attack , electronic warfare , and signals intelligence roles .	0
377	Lockheed Martin Aeronautics is the prime contractor and is responsible for the majority of the airframe , weapon systems and final assembly of the F-22 .	0
378	Program partner Boeing Defense , Space & Security provides the wings , aft fuselage , avionics integration , and training systems .	0
379	The aircraft was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 during the years prior to formally entering USAF service in December 2005 as the F-22A .	0
380	Despite a protracted and costly development period , the United States Air Force considers the F-22 a critical component of U.S. tactical air power , and claims that the aircraft is unmatched by any known or projected fighter .	0
381	Lockheed Martin claims that the Raptor 's combination of stealth , speed , agility , precision and situational awareness , combined with air-to-air and air-to-ground combat capabilities , makes it the best overall fighter in the world today .	0
382	Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston , former Chief of the Australian Defence Force , said in 2004 that the `` F-22 will be the most outstanding fighter plane ever built . ''	0
383	The high cost of the aircraft , a lack of clear air-to-air combat missions because of delays in the Russian and Chinese fifth-generation fighter programs , a U.S. ban on Raptor exports , and the ongoing development of the planned cheaper and more versatile F-35 resulted in calls to end F-22 production .	0
384	In April 2009 , the U.S. Department of Defense proposed to cease placing new orders , subject to Congressional approval , for a final procurement tally of 187 operational aircraft .	0
385	The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 lacked funding for further F-22 production .	0
386	The final F-22 rolled off the assembly line on 13 December 2011 during a ceremony at Dobbins Air Reserve Base .	0
387	Since 2010 the F-22 has been plagued by unresolved problems with its pilot oxygen systems which contributed to one crash and death of a pilot .	0
388	In 2011 the fleet was grounded for four months before resuming flight operations , but reports of oxygen systems issues have continued .	0
389	In July 2012 , the Air Force announced that the hypoxia-like symptoms experienced were caused by a faulty valve in the pilots ' pressure vest ; the valve was replaced and changes to the filtration system were also made .	0

393	An ocean ( ; the World Ocean of classical antiquity ) is a body of saline water that composes a large part of a planet 's hydrosphere .	0
394	In the context of Earth , it refers to one or all of the major divisions of the planet 's World Ocean – they are , in descending order of area , the Pacific , Atlantic , Indian , Southern ( Antarctic ) , and Arctic Oceans .	1
395	The word `` sea `` is often used interchangeably with `` ocean '' , but strictly speaking a sea is a body of saline water ( possibly a division of the World Ocean ) partly or fully enclosed by land .	0
396	Earth is the only planet known to have an ocean ( or any large amounts of open liquid water ) .	0
397	Approximately 72 % of the planet 's surface ( ~3.6x108 km2 ) is covered by saline water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas , with the ocean covering approximately 71 % of the Earth 's surface .	0
398	In terms of the hydrosphere of the Earth , the ocean contains 97 % of the Earth 's water .	0
399	Oceanographers have stated that out of 97 % , only 5 % of the ocean as a whole on Earth has been explored .	0
400	Because it is the principal component of Earth 's hydrosphere , the world ocean is integral to all known life , forms part of the carbon cycle , and influences climate and weather patterns .	0
401	The total volume is approximately 1.3 billion cubic kilometres ( 310 million cu mi ) with an average depth of .	0
402	It is the habitat of 230,000 known species , although much of the ocean 's depths remain unexplored and it is estimated that over two million marine species exist .	0
403	The origin of Earth 's oceans is still unknown , but oceans are believed to have formed in the Hadean period and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life .	0
404	Extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of a wide range of elements and compounds .	0
405	The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of Titan , although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the Solar System .	0
406	Early in their geologic histories , Mars and Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans .	0
407	The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water , though the water on Mars is no longer oceanic , and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus .	0
408	Compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point , so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice .	0
409	Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites ; notably , the ocean of Europa is believed to have over twice the water volume of Earth .	0
410	The Solar System 's gas giant planets are also believed to possess liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions .	0
411	Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons , including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone .	0
412	Ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid .	0

429	Diagnosis-related group ( DRG ) is a system to classify hospital cases into one of originally 467 groups .	0
430	The 467th group was `` Ungroupable '' .	0
431	This system of classification was developed as a collaborative project by Robert B Fetter , PhD , of the Yale School of Management , and John D Thompson , MPH , of the Yale School of Public Health .	0
432	The system is also referred to as `` the DRGs '' , and its intent was to identify the `` products '' that a hospital provides .	0
433	One example of a `` product '' is an appendectomy .	0
434	The system was developed in anticipation of convincing Congress to use it for reimbursement , to replace `` cost based '' reimbursement that had been used up to that point .	0
435	DRGs are assigned by a `` grouper '' program based on ICD ( International Classification of Diseases ) diagnoses , procedures , age , sex , discharge status , and the presence of complications or comorbidities .	0
436	DRGs have been used in the US since 1982 to determine how much Medicare pays the hospital for each `` product '' , since patients within each category are clinically similar and are expected to use the same level of hospital resources .	0
437	DRGs may be further grouped into Major Diagnostic Categories ( MDCs ) .	0
438	DRGs are also standard practice for establishing reimbursements for other Medicare related reimbursements such as to home healthcare providers .	0

444	The Mariana Trench in the western North Pacific is the deepest point in the world , reaching a depth of .	0
445	The eastern Pacific Ocean was first sighted by Europeans in the early 16th century when Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama in 1513 and discovered the great `` southern sea '' which he named Mar del Sur .	0
446	The ocean 's current name was bestowed by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan during the Spanish expedition of world circumnavigation in 1521 , who encountered favourable winds as he reached the ocean and called it Mar Pacifico in Portuguese , meaning `` peaceful sea '' .	0
447	The plus-minus sign ( ) is a mathematical symbol commonly used either	0
448	to indicate the precision of an approximation , or	1
449	to indicate a value that can be of either sign .	1
450	The sign is normally pronounced `` plus or minus '' .	0
451	In experimental sciences , the sign commonly indicates the confidence interval or error in a measurement , often the standard deviation or standard error .	0

455	Judgment as a matter of law ( JMOL ) is a motion made by a party , during trial , claiming the opposing party has insufficient evidence to reasonably support its case .	1
456	JMOL is also known as a directed verdict , which it has replaced in American Federal courts .	0
457	JMOL is similar to judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment , all of which test the factual sufficiency of a claim .	0
458	Judgment on the pleadings is a motion made after pleading and before discovery ; summary judgment happens after discovery and before trial ; JMOL occurs during trial .	0
459	In United States federal courts , JMOL is a creation of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 50 .	0
460	JMOL is decided by the standard of whether a reasonable jury could find in favor of the party opposing the JMOL motion .	0
461	If there is no evidence to support a reasonable conclusion for the opposing party , judgment is entered by the court and the case is over .	0
462	If there is sufficient evidence to make a reasonable conclusion in favor of the opposing party , but there is equally strong evidence to support an opposite conclusion , the party with the burden of persuasion fails .	0
463	Timing is very important in making a motion for JMOL ; the motion can only be made once the opposing party has presented its case .	0
464	In civil cases , the plaintiff presents her case , then the defendant presents his/her case , then the plaintiff may present a rebuttal .	0
465	So , once the plaintiff has presented his/her case , the defendant may move for JMOL , but the plaintiff may not .	0
466	Once the defendant has finished presenting his/her case , the plaintiff may move for JMOL , and so may the defendant .	0
467	JMOL motions may also be made after the verdict is returned , where they are called `` renewed '' motions for judgment as a matter of law ( RJMOL ) , but the motion is still commonly known by its former name , judgment notwithstanding verdict , or j.n.o.v . ( from the English judgment and the Latin non obstante veredicto ) .	0
468	However , in order to move for j.n.o.v. , the movant must have moved for a JMOL before the verdict as well .	0
469	This procedural quirk is necessary because it is considered a violation of the 7th amendment for a judge to overturn a jury verdict .	0
470	Instead , the judge is said in a j.n.o.v . to be reexamining not the verdict , but his previous rejection of JMOL .	0

476	They further maintain that Jesus bodily ascended into heaven where he rules and reigns with God the Father .	0
477	Most denominations teach that Jesus will return to judge all humans , living and dead , and grant eternal life to his followers .	0

513	A season is a subdivision of the year , marked by changes in weather , ecology , and hours of daylight .	1
514	Seasons result from the yearly revolution of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth 's axis relative to the plane of revolution .	1
515	In temperate and polar regions , the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth 's surface , variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate , and plants to be dormant .	0
516	During May , June and July , the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun .	0
517	The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November , December and January .	0
518	It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux .	1
519	However , due to seasonal lag , June , July and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December , January and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere .	0
520	In temperate and subpolar regions , generally four calendar -based seasons ( with their adjectives ) are recognized : spring ( vernal ) , summer ( estival ) , autumn ( autumnal ) and winter ( hibernal ) .	0
521	However , ecologists mostly use a six season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring ( prevernal ) and late summer ( serotinal ) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four .	0
522	Hot regions have two or three seasons ; the rainy ( or wet , or monsoon ) season and the dry season , and in some tropical areas , a cool or mild season .	0

526	Color blindness or color vision deficiency is the inability or decreased ability to see color , or perceive color differences , under normal lighting conditions .	0
527	Color blindness affects a significant percentage of the population .	0
528	There is no actual blindness but there is a deficiency of color vision .	0
529	The most usual cause is a fault in the development of one or more sets of retinal cones that perceive color in light and transmit that information to the optic nerve .	0
530	This type of color blindness is usually a sex-linked condition .	0
531	The genes that produce photopigments are carried on the X chromosome ; if some of these genes are missing or damaged , color blindness will be expressed in males with a higher probability than in females because males only have one X chromosome ( in females , a functional gene on only one of the two X chromosomes is sufficient to yield the needed photopigments ) .	0
532	Color blindness can also be produced by physical or chemical damage to the eye , the optic nerve , or parts of the brain .	0
533	For example , people with achromatopsia suffer from a completely different disorder , but are nevertheless unable to see colors .	0
534	The English chemist John Dalton published the first scientific paper on this subject in 1798 , `` Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours '' , after the realization of his own color blindness .	0
535	Because of Dalton 's work , the general condition has been called daltonism , although in English this term is now used more narrowly for deuteranopia alone .	0
536	Color blindness is usually classified as a mild disability , however there are occasional circumstances where it can give an advantage .	0
537	Some studies conclude that color blind people are better at penetrating certain color camouflages .	0
538	Such findings may give an evolutionary reason for the high prevalence of red–green color blindness .	0
539	And there is also a study suggesting that people with some types of color blindness can distinguish colors that people with normal color vision are not able to distinguish .	0

545	The history of slavery covers slave systems in historical perspective in which one human being is legally the property of another , can be bought or sold , is not allowed to escape and must work for the owner without any choice involved .	0
546	As Drescher ( 2009 ) argues , `` The most crucial and frequently utilized aspect of the condition is a communally recognized right by some individuals to possess , buy , sell , discipline , transport , liberate , or otherwise dispose of the bodies and behavior of other individuals . ''	0
547	An integral element is that children of a slave mother automatically become slaves .	0
548	It does not include historical forced labor by prisoners , labor camps , or other forms of unfree labor in which laborers are not considered property .	0
549	Slavery can be traced back to the earliest records , such as the Code of Hammurabi ( c. 1760 BC ) , which refers to it as an established institution .	0
550	Slavery is rare among hunter-gatherer populations as slavery depends on a system of social stratification .	0
551	Slavery typically also requires a shortage of labor and a surplus of land to be viable .	0
552	David P. Forsythe wrote : `` The fact remained that at the beginning of the nineteenth century an estimated three-quarters of all people alive were trapped in bondage against their will either in some form of slavery or serfdom . ''	0
553	Slavery is no longer legal anywhere in the world .	0
554	Mauritania abolished it in law in 1981 and was the last country to do so – see Abolition of slavery timeline .	0

713	The thyroid hormones , triiodothyronine ( T3 ) and thyroxine ( T4 ) , are tyrosine -based hormones produced by the thyroid gland that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism .	1
714	Iodine is necessary for the production of T3 and T4 .	0
715	A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T3 and T4 , enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as goitre .	0
716	The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine ( T4 ) , which has a longer half-life than T3 .	0
717	The ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is roughly 20 to 1 .	0
718	T4 is converted to the active T3 ( three to four times more potent than T4 ) within cells by deiodinases ( 5'-iodinase ) .	0
719	These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine ( T1a ) and thyronamine ( T0a ) .	0
720	All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes , thus dietary selenium is essential for T3 production .	0

820	A diaphragm pump ( also known as a Membrane pump , Air Operated Double Diaphragm Pump ( AODD ) or Pneumatic Diaphragm Pump ) is a positive displacement pump that uses a combination of the reciprocating action of a rubber , thermoplastic or teflon diaphragm and suitable valves either side of the diaphragm ( check valve , butterfly valves , flap valves , or any other form of shut-off valves ) to pump a fluid .	1
821	There are three main types of diaphragm pumps:	0
822	Those in which the diaphragm is sealed with one side in the fluid to be pumped , and the other in air or hydraulic fluid .	0
823	The diaphragm is flexed , causing the volume of the pump chamber to increase and decrease .	0
824	A pair of non-return check valves prevent reverse flow of the fluid .	0
825	Those employing volumetric positive displacement where the prime mover of the diaphragm is electro-mechanical , working through a crank or geared motor drive , or purely mechanical , such as with a lever or handle .	0
826	This method flexes the diaphragm through simple mechanical action , and one side of the diaphragm is open to air .	0
827	Those employing one or more unsealed diaphragms with the fluid to be pumped on both sides .	0
828	The diaphragm ( s ) again are flexed , causing the volume to change .	0
829	When the volume of a chamber of either type of pump is increased ( the diaphragm moving up ) , the pressure decreases , and fluid is drawn into the chamber .	0
830	When the chamber pressure later increases from decreased volume ( the diaphragm moving down ) , the fluid previously drawn in is forced out .	0
831	Finally , the diaphragm moving up once again draws fluid into the chamber , completing the cycle .	0

915	The break in the column of mercury is visible .	0
916	The mercury-in-glass or mercury thermometer was invented by German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in 1714 .	0
917	It consists of a bulb containing mercury attached to a glass tube of narrow diameter ; the volume of mercury in the tube is much less than the volume in the bulb .	0
918	The volume of mercury changes slightly with temperature ; the small change in volume drives the narrow mercury column a relatively long way up the tube .	0
919	The space above the mercury may be filled with nitrogen or it may be at less than atmospheric pressure , a partial vacuum .	0
920	In order to calibrate the thermometer , the bulb is made to reach thermal equilibrium with a temperature standard such as an ice/water mixture , and then with another standard such as water/vapour , and the tube is divided into regular intervals between the fixed points .	0
921	In principle , thermometers made of different material ( e.g. , coloured alcohol ) might be expected to give different intermediate readings due to different expansion properties ; in practice the substances used are chosen to have reasonably linear expansion characteristics as a function of true thermodynamic temperature , and so give similar results .	0

991	New Berlin Observatory at Linden Street , where Neptune was discovered observationally .	0
992	The planet Neptune was mathematically predicted before it was directly observed .	0
993	With a prediction by Urbain Le Verrier , telescopic observations confirming the existence of a major planet were made on the night of September 23–24 , 1846 , at the Berlin Observatory , by astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle ( assisted by Heinrich Louis d'Arrest ) , working from Le Verrier 's calculations .	1
994	It was a sensational moment of 19th century science and dramatic confirmation of Newtonian gravitational theory .	0
995	In François Arago 's apt phrase , Le Verrier had discovered a planet `` with the point of his pen '' .	0
996	In retrospect , after it was discovered it turned out it had been observed many times before but not recognized , and there were others who made various calculations about its location , which did not lead to its observation .	0
997	By 1846 the planet Uranus had completed nearly one full orbit since its discovery by William Herschel in 1781 , and astronomers had detected a series of irregularities in its path which could not be entirely explained by Newton 's law of gravitation .	0
998	These irregularities could , however , be resolved if the gravity of a farther , unknown planet were disturbing its path around the Sun .	0
999	In 1845 astronomers Urbain Le Verrier in Paris and John Couch Adams in Cambridge separately began calculations to determine the nature and position of such a planet .	0
1000	Unfortunately , Le Verrier 's triumph also led to a tense international dispute over priority , as , shortly after the discovery , George Airy , at the time British Astronomer Royal , announced that Adams had also predicted the discovery of the planet .	0
1001	Nevertheless , the Royal Society awarded Le Verrier the Copley medal in 1846 for his achievement , without mention of Adams .	0

1026	Lutheranism is a major branch of Western Christianity that identifies with the theology of Martin Luther , a German reformer .	0
1027	Luther 's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the Roman Catholic Church launched the Protestant Reformation .	0
1028	Beginning with the 95 Theses , Luther 's writings were disseminated internationally , spreading the ideas of the Reformation beyond the ability of governmental and churchly authorities to control it .	0
1029	The split between the Lutherans and the Roman Catholics began with the 1521 Edict of Worms , which condemned Luther and officially outlawed citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending his ideas .	0
1030	The punishment decreed for Lutheranism was seizure of all property , with half going to the Imperial government and half given to their accusers .	0
1031	The divide centered over the doctrine of Justification .	0
1032	Lutheranism advocates a doctrine of justification `` by grace alone through faith alone because of Christ alone , '' which went against the Roman view of `` faith formed by love '' , or `` faith and works '' .	0
1033	Unlike the Reformed Churches , Lutherans retain a high respect for the authority of the Church Fathers , as well as many of the liturgical practices and sacramental teachings of the pre-Reformation Church , with a particular emphasis on the Eucharist , or Lord 's Supper .	0
1034	Lutheran theology significantly differs from Reformed theology in Christology , the purpose of God 's Law , the divine grace , the concept of perseverance of the saints , and predestination .	0

1039	The Berlin blockade ( 24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949 ) was one of the first major international crises of the Cold War .	0
1040	During the multinational occupation of post–World War II Germany , the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies ' railway , road , and canal access to the sectors of Berlin under Allied control .	0
1041	Their aim was to force the western powers to allow the Soviet zone to start supplying Berlin with food and fuel , thereby giving the Soviets practical control over the entire city .	1
1042	In response , the Western Allies organized the Berlin airlift to carry supplies to the people in West Berlin .	0
1043	Aircrews from the United States Air Force , the British Royal Air Force , the Royal Australian Air Force , the Royal Canadian Air Force , the Royal New Zealand Air Force , and the South African Air Force flew over 200,000 flights in one year , providing up to 4700 tons of daily necessities such as fuel and food to the Berliners .	0
1044	By the spring of 1949 , the effort was clearly succeeding and , by April , the airlift was delivering more cargo than had previously been transported into the city by rail .	0
1045	The success of the Berlin Airlift brought embarrassment to the Soviets who had refused to believe it could make a difference .	0
1046	The blockade was lifted in May 1949 and resulted in the creation of two separate German states .	0
1047	The Federal Republic of Germany ( West Germany ) and the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) split up Berlin .	0

1051	The song became a hit in the United States , peaking at # 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1969 , the first of five non-consecutive singles to peak at # 2 for the group .	0
1052	In physiology , body water is the water content of the human body .	0
1053	A significant fraction of the human body is water .	0
1054	Arthur Guyton 's Textbook of Medical Physiology states that `` the total amount of water in a man of average weight ( 70 kilograms ) is approximately 40 litres , averaging 57 percent of his total body weight .	1
1055	In a newborn infant , this may be as high as 75 percent of the body weight , but it progressively decreases from birth to old age , most of the decrease occurring during the first 10 years of life .	0
1056	Also , obesity decreases the percentage of water in the body , sometimes to as low as 45 percent '' .	0
1057	These figures are statistical averages , so are illustrative , and like all biostatistics , will vary with things like type of population , age and number of people sampled , and methodology .	0
1058	So there is not , and can not be , a figure that is exactly the same for all people , for this or any other physiological measure .	0
1059	For example , Jackson 's ( 1985 ) Anatomy & Physiology for Nurses gives a figure of 60 % for the proportion of body-weight attributable to water , which approximates Guyton 's 57 % .	0
1060	In diseased states where body water is affected , the compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem .	0
1061	Body water is regulated by hormones , including anti-diuretic hormone ( ADH ) , aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide .	0
1062	Per Netter 's Atlas of Human Physiology , body water is broken down into the following compartments:	0
1063	Intracellular fluid ( 2/3 of body water ) .	0
1064	Per Guyton , in a body containing 40 litres of fluid , about 25 litres is intracellular , which amounts to 62.5 % ( 5/8 ) , close enough to the 2/3 rule of thumb .	0
1065	Jackson 's texts states 70 % of body fluid is intracellular .	0
1066	Extracellular fluid ( 1/3 of body water ) .	0
1067	Per Guyton 's illustration , for a 40 litre body , about 15 litres is extracellular , which amounts to 37.5 % Again , this is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb cited here .	0
1068	Plasma ( 1/5 of extracellular fluid ) .	0
1069	Per Guyton 's illustration , of the 15 litres of extracellular fluid , plasma volume averages 3 litres .	0
1070	This amounts to 20 % , the same as per Netter 's Atlas .	0
1071	Interstitial fluid ( 4/5 of extracellular fluid )	0
1072	Transcellular fluid ( a.k.a . `` third space , '' normally ignored in calculations )	0
1073	Contained inside organs , such as the gastrointestinal , cerebrospinal , peritoneal , and ocular fluids .	0

1076	The economic , social , and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding ethnicity , economic benefits , jobs for non-immigrants , settlement patterns , impact on upward social mobility , crime , and voting behavior .	0
1077	In 2006 the United States accepted more legal immigrants as permanent residents than all other countries in the world combined .	0
1078	After ethnic quotas on immigration were removed in 1965 the number of actual ( first-generation ) immigrants living in the United States eventually quadrupled , from 9.6 million in 1970 to about 38 million in 2007 .	0
1079	Over one million persons were naturalized as U.S. citizens in 2008 .	0
1080	The leading countries of origin of immigrants to the United States were Mexico , India , the Philippines , and China .	0
1081	Nearly 14 million immigrants entered the United States from 2000 to 2010 .	0
1082	Family reunification accounts for approximately two-thirds of legal immigration to the US every year .	0
1083	The number of foreign nationals who became legal permanent residents ( LPRs ) of the U.S. in 2009 as a result of family reunification ( 66 % ) exceeded those who became LPRs on the basis of employment skills ( 13 % ) and for humanitarian reasons ( 17 % ) .	0
1084	Migration is difficult , expensive , and dangerous for those who enter the US illegally across the Mexico–United States border .	0
1085	Participants in debates on immigration in the early twenty-first century called for increasing enforcement of existing laws governing illegal immigration to the United States , building a barrier along some or all of the U.S.-Mexico border , or creating a new guest worker program .	0
1086	Through much of 2006 the country and Congress was immersed in a debate about these proposals .	0
1087	few of these proposals had become law , though a partial border fence had been approved and subsequently canceled .	0

1089	Drywall ( also known as plasterboard , wallboard , gypsum board , or gyprock ) is a panel made of gypsum plaster pressed between two thick sheets of paper .	0
1090	It is used to make interior walls and ceilings .	0
1091	Drywall construction became prevalent as a speedier alternative to traditional lath and plaster .	0
1092	In many places , the common term is a genericized trademark such as sheetrock or gyproc .	0
1093	In New Zealand the category is known as `` plasterboard '' or `` gib board '' ( originally `` Gibraltar board '' ) , the latter being a proprietary brand name but now largely a genericised trademark .	0

1097	Forensic facial reconstruction ( or forensic facial approximation ) is the process of recreating the face of an individual ( whose identity is often not known ) from their skeletal remains through an amalgamation of artistry , forensic science , anthropology , osteology , and anatomy .	0
1098	It is easily the most subjective—as well as one of the most controversial—techniques in the field of forensic anthropology .	0
1099	Despite this controversy , facial reconstruction has proved successful frequently enough that research and methodological developments continue to be advanced .	0
1100	In addition to remains involved in criminal investigations , facial reconstructions are created for remains believed to be of historical value and for remains of prehistoric hominids and humans .	0
1101	Personifications of Germany , France , Russia , Austria-Hungary , and the United Kingdom attempting to keep the lid on the simmering cauldron of imperialist and nationalist tensions in the Balkans to prevent a general European war .	0
1102	They were successful in 1912 and 1913 but did not succeed in in 1914 .	0
1103	The causes of World War I , which began in central Europe in late July 1914 and finished in 1918 , included many factors , such as the conflicts and hostility of the four decades leading up to the war .	1
1104	Militarism , alliances , imperialism , and nationalism played major roles in the conflict as well .	0
1105	The immediate origins of the war , however , lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the Crisis of 1914 , casus belli for which was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand ( the Archduke of Austria Hungary ) and his wife Sophie by Gavrilo Princip , an irredentist Serb .	0
1106	The crisis came after a long and difficult series of diplomatic clashes between the Great Powers ( Italy , France , Germany , the British Empire , the Austria-Hungarian Empire and Russia ) over European and colonial issues in the decade before 1914 that had left tensions high .	0
1107	In turn these diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe since 1867 .	0
1108	The more immediate cause for the war was tensions over territory in the Balkans .	0
1109	Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the Great Powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties .	0
1110	Although the chain of events unleashed by the assassination triggered the war , the war 's origins go deeper , involving national politics , cultures , economics , and a complex web of alliances and counterbalances that had developed between the various European powers since 1870 .	0
1111	Some of the most important long term or structural causes are : the growth of nationalism across Europe , unresolved territorial disputes , an intricate system of alliances , the perceived breakdown of the balance of power in Europe , convoluted and fragmented governance , the arms races of the previous decades , previous military planning , imperial and colonial rivalry for wealth , power and prestige , and economic and military rivalry in industry and trade – e.g. , the Pig War between Austria and Serbia .	0
1112	Other causes that came into play during the diplomatic crisis that preceded the war included misperceptions of intent ( e.g. , the German belief that the United Kingdom would remain neutral ) and delays and misunderstandings in diplomatic communications .	0
1113	The various categories of explanation for World War I correspond to different historians ' overall methods .	0
1114	Most historians and popular commentators include causes from more than one category of explanation to provide a rounded account of the causes of the war .	0
1115	The deepest distinction among these accounts is between stories that see it as the inevitable and predictable outcome of certain factors , and those that describe it as an arbitrary and unfortunate mistake .	0
1116	In attributing causes for the war , historians and academics had to deal with an unprecedented flood of memoirs and official documents , released as each country involved tried to avoid blame for starting the war .	0
1117	Early releases of information by governments , particularly those released for use by the `` Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War '' were shown to be incomplete and biased .	0
1118	In addition some documents , especially diplomatic cables between Russia and France , were found to have been doctored .	0
1119	Even in later decades however , when much more information had been released , historians from the same culture have been shown to come to differing conclusions on the causes of the war .	0

1124	An 1877 color photo by Louis Ducos du Hauron , a French pioneer of color photography .	0
1125	The overlapping subtractive yellow , cyan and red ( magenta ) image elements can clearly be seen .	1
1126	A subtractive color model explains the mixing of a limited set of dyes , inks , paint pigments or natural colorants to create a wider range of colors , each the result of partially or completely subtracting ( that is , absorbing ) some wavelengths of light and not others .	0
1127	The color that a surface displays depends on which parts of the visible spectrum are not absorbed and therefore remain visible .	0
1128	Subtractive color systems start with light , presumably white light .	0
1129	Colored inks , paints , or filters between the viewer and the light source or reflective surface subtract wavelengths from the light , giving it color .	0
1130	If the incident light is other than white , our visual mechanisms are able to compensate well , but not perfectly , often giving a flawed impression of the `` true '' color of the surface .	0
1131	Conversely , additive color systems start with darkness .	0
1132	Light sources of various wavelengths are added in various proportions to produce a range of colors .	0
1133	The component lights may be inherently colored or simply white light that has passed through suitable subtractive color filters ; their combination is an additive one in either case .	0
1134	Usually , three primary colors are combined to stimulate humans’ trichromatic color vision , sensed by the three types of cone cells in the eye , giving an apparently full range .	0

1139	The Xerox Alto was the first to use a graphical user interface .	0
1140	In computing , graphical user interface ( GUI , sometimes pronounced 'gooey ' ) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices using images rather than text commands .	0
1141	GUIs can be used in computers , hand-held devices such as MP3 players , portable media players or gaming devices , household appliances , office , and industry equipment .	1
1142	A GUI represents the information and actions available to a user through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation , as opposed to text-based interfaces , typed command labels or text navigation .	0
1143	The actions are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements .	0
1144	The term GUI is restricted to the scope of two-dimensional display screens with display resolutions able to describe generic information , in the tradition of the computer science research at the PARC ( Palo Alto Research Center ) .	0
1145	The term GUI is not usually applied to other low-resolution types of interfaces that are non-generic , such as video games ( where HUD is preferred ) , or not restricted to flat screens , like volumetric displays .	0

1148	A banana connector ( commonly banana plug for the male , banana socket or banana jack for the female ) is a single- wire ( one conductor ) electrical connector used for joining wires to equipment .	1
1149	The term 4 mm connector is also used , especially in Europe , although not all banana connectors will mate with 4 mm parts .	0
1150	The plugs are frequently used to terminate patch cords for electronic test equipment .	0
1151	They are also often used as the plugs on the cables connecting the amplifier to the loudspeakers in hi-fi sound systems .	0
1152	The plug was invented in 1924 by Richard Hirschmann ( former Richard Hirschmann GmbH & Co . ) .	0
1153	In Greek mythology , the Trojan War was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans ( Greeks ) after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus king of Sparta .	0
1154	The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature , most notably through Homer 's Iliad and the Odyssey .	0
1155	The Iliad relates a part of the last year of the siege of Troy ; the Odyssey describes Odysseus 's journey home .	0
1156	Other parts of the war are contained in a cycle of epic poems , which have survived through fragments .	0
1157	Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature , and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid .	0
1158	The war originated from a quarrel between the goddesses Athena , Hera , and Aphrodite , after Eris , the goddess of strife and discord , gave them a golden apple , sometimes known as the Apple of Discord , marked `` for the fairest '' .	0
1159	Zeus sent the goddesses to Paris , who judged that Aphrodite , as the `` fairest '' , should receive the apple .	0
1160	In exchange , Aphrodite made Helen , the most beautiful of all women and wife of Menelaus , fall in love with Paris , who took her to Troy .	0
1161	Agamemnon , king of Mycenae and the brother of Helen 's husband Menelaus , led an expedition of Achaean troops to Troy and besieged the city for ten years because of Paris ' insult .	0
1162	After the deaths of many heroes , including the Achaeans Achilles and Ajax , and the Trojans Hector and Paris , the city fell to the ruse of the Trojan Horse .	0
1163	The Achaeans slaughtered the Trojans ( except for some of the women and children whom they kept or sold as slaves ) and desecrated the temples , thus earning the gods ' wrath .	0
1164	Few of the Achaeans returned safely to their homes and many founded colonies in distant shores .	0
1165	The Romans later traced their origin to Aeneas , one of the Trojans , who was said to have led the surviving Trojans to modern-day Italy .	0
1166	The ancient Greeks thought that the Trojan War was a historical event that had taken place in the 13th or 12th century BC , and believed that Troy was located in modern-day Turkey near the Dardanelles .	1
1167	By modern times , both the war and the city were widely believed to be non-historical .	0
1168	In 1868 , however , the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann met Frank Calvert , who convinced Schliemann that Troy was at Hissarlik and Schliemann took over Calvert 's excavations on property belonging to Calvert ; this claim is now accepted by most scholars .	0
1169	Whether there is any historical reality behind the Trojan War is an open question .	0
1170	Many scholars believe that there is a historical core to the tale , though this may simply mean that the Homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges and expeditions by Mycenaean Greeks during the Bronze Age .	0
1171	Those who believe that the stories of the Trojan War are derived from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or 11th centuries BC , often preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes , 1194–1184 BC , which roughly corresponds with archaeological evidence of a catastrophic burning of Troy VIIa .	0

1173	The Fugitive Slave Law or Fugitive Slave Act was passed by the United States Congress on September 18 , 1850 , as part of the Compromise of 1850 between Southern slave-holding interests and Northern Free-Soilers .	0
1174	This was one of the most controversial acts of the 1850 compromise and heightened Northern fears of a `` slave power conspiracy '' .	0
1175	It declared that all runaway slaves were , upon capture , to be returned to their masters .	0
1176	Abolitionists nicknamed it the `` Bloodhound Law '' for the dogs that were used to track down runaway slaves .	0
1177	Crystallization is the ( natural or artificial ) process of formation of solid crystals precipitating from a solution , melt or more rarely deposited directly from a gas .	0
1178	Crystallization is also a chemical solid–liquid separation technique , in which mass transfer of a solute from the liquid solution to a pure solid crystalline phase occurs .	0
1179	In chemical engineering crystallization occurs in a crystallizer .	0
1180	Crystallization is therefore an aspect of precipitation , obtained through a variation of the solubility conditions of the solute in the solvent , as compared to precipitation due to chemical reaction .	0

1454	The Monte Carlo endured six design generations .	0
1455	The first four ( 1970–72 , 1973–77 , 1978–80 and 1981–88 ) were of a rear-wheel-drive , V8-powered ( V6 available beginning in 1978 ) coupe style , utilizing separate body-on-frame construction .	0
1456	The later rear-wheel-drive generations bucked the trend of unit-body construction , along with smaller engines , that became more prevalent in the early 1980s as automakers downsized their vehicle lines to meet increasing stringent fuel-economy regulations in the aftermath of two energy crises that led to gasoline shortages and skyrocketing pump prices in 1973-74 and 1979-80 .	0
1457	Despite those trends , the Monte Carlo remained a popular seller and even regained the SS version ( initially offered for 1970-71 with 454 cubic-inch V8 ) from mid-1983 to 1988 with a high-performance 305-cubic-inch V8 .	0

1465	In political philosophy the social contract or political contract is a theory or model , originating during the Age of Enlightenment , that typically addresses the questions of the origin of society and the legitimacy of the authority of the state over the individual .	0
1466	Social contract arguments typically posit that individuals have consented , either explicitly or tacitly , to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the ruler or magistrate ( or to the decision of a majority ) , in exchange for protection of their remaining rights .	0
1467	The question of the relation between natural and legal rights , therefore , is often an aspect of social contract theory .	0
1468	Although the antecedents of social contract theory are found in antiquity , in Greek and Stoic philosophy and Roman and Canon Law , as well as in the Biblical idea of the covenant , the heyday of the social contract was the mid-seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries , when it emerged as the leading doctrine of political legitimacy .	0
1469	The starting point for most social contract theories is a heuristic examination of the human condition absent from any political order that Thomas Hobbes termed the “ state of nature ” .	0
1470	In this condition , individuals ' actions are bound only by their personal power and conscience .	0
1471	From this shared starting point social contract theorists seek to demonstrate , in different ways , why a rational individual would voluntarily consent to give up his or her natural freedom to obtain the benefits of political order .	0
1472	Hugo Grotius ( 1625 ) , Thomas Hobbes ( 1651 ) , Samuel Pufendorf ( 1673 ) , John Locke ( 1689 ) , Jean-Jacques Rousseau ( 1762 ) , and Immanuel Kant ( 1797 ) are among the most prominent of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century theorists of social contract and natural rights .	0
1473	Each solved the problem of political authority in a different way .	0
1474	Grotius posited that individual human beings had natural rights ; Hobbes asserted that men consent to abdicate their rights in favor of the absolute authority of government ( whether monarchial or parliamentary ) ; Pufendorf disputed Hobbes 's equation of a state of nature with war .	0
1475	Locke believed that natural rights were inalienable , and that the rule of God therefore superseded government authority ; and Rousseau believed that democracy ( self-rule ) was the best way of ensuring the general welfare while maintaining individual freedom under the rule of law .	0
1476	The Lockean concept of the social contract was invoked in the United States Declaration of Independence .	0
1477	Social contract theories were eclipsed in the nineteenth century in favor of utilitarianism , Hegelianism , and Marxism , and were revived in the twentieth , notably in the form of a thought experiment by John Rawls .	0

2151	Map of the Arctic with the Arctic Circle in blue .	0
2152	The Arctic Circle is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth .	0
2153	In 2012 , it is the parallel of latitude that runs north of the Equator .	0
2154	The region north of this circle is known as the Arctic , and the zone just to the south is called the Northern Temperate Zone .	0
2155	The equivalent polar circle in the Southern Hemisphere is called the Antarctic Circle .	0
2156	The Arctic Circle is the southernmost latitude in the Northern Hemisphere at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for 24 hours ( at the June solstice and December solstice respectively ) .	1
2157	North of the Arctic Circle , the sun is above the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year ( and therefore visible at midnight ) and below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year .	0
2158	On the Arctic Circle those events occur , in principle , exactly once per year , at the June and December solstices , respectively .	0
2159	It would therefore seem that the Arctic Circle marks the southern extremity of the northern hemisphere polar day ( 24-hour sunlit day , often referred to as the midnight sun ) and polar night ( 24-hour sunless night ) .	0
2160	In fact , because of atmospheric refraction and mirages , and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point , part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the northern summer solstice up to about 50 ′ ( ) south of the Arctic Circle ; similarly , on the day of the northern winter solstice , part of the sun may be seen up to about 50′ north of the Arctic Circle .	0
2161	That is true at sea level ; those limits increase with elevation above sea level although in mountainous regions , there is often no direct view of the true horizon .	0
2162	The position of the Arctic Circle is not fixed .	0
2163	It directly depends on the Earth 's axial tilt , which fluctuates within a margin of 2° over a 40,000 year period , notably due to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the Moon .	0
2164	The Arctic Circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about per year ; see Circle of latitude for more information .	0
